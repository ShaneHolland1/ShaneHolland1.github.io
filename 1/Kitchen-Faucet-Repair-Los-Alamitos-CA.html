It is often used to replace copper pipes as well and is used for a number of other plumbing applications. PEX pipes are understood to be more heat resistant than other kinds of piping. They are thought about safe and are frequently used to bring drinking water in brand-new constructions.</p>
<p>If there is backflow at your home, you could infect your drinking water with non-treated water from an irrigation canal or water pooled around a sprinkler head that has fertilizer on it.
