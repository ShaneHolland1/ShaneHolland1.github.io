In commercial applications, for instance, AWWA M-14: Backflow Prevention and Cross-Connection Control Recommended Practices suggests a DCV assembly on dry or wet sprinkler systems unless there is a danger of a high-hazard cross-connection. In those cases, an RPZ assembly is suggested.</p>
<p>A backflow preventer is a means or system to prevent backflow. The basic methods of avoiding backflow is an air space, which either eliminates a cross-connection or supplies a barrier to backflow. The basic system for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which supplies a physical barrier to backflow. The primary kinds of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure concept assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the check valve assembly. A secondary kind of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential double check valve.</p>
