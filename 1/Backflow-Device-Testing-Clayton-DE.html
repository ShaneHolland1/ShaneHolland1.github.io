<h3>Plumbing Services Around Clayton DE</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were believed to be a better alternative to galvanized and polybutylene piping. Regrettably, one brand is experiencing a great deal of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a great deal of oxidization. This causes cracks in the tubing that can cause leaks. As these leaks take place, zinc is seeped from the fittings on the pipes, triggering them to weaken. Lastly, chlorinated water has actually been found to cause fractures in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the best service to all of these issues.</p>
<p>A brand-new trend in re-piping is sand blasting the inside of worn thin pipe and the painting the within the worn pipe with epoxy paint. Often during the sandblasting the sandblasting will wear thin and blow through the wall of joints and pipes. Some of those thin areas leak right away and often those leaks come weeks or days later. Leaking pipes that are epoxy-coated wind up needing to be correctly re-piped by setting up a CDA copper re-pipe.</p>
