<p>Loose flanges are usually the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws simply won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best solution depends on the level of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>
