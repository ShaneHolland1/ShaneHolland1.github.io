<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable water supply pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
