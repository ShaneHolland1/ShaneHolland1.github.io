<p>After showing up after their window, they started to examine the kitchen sink (and after one of the 2 gentlemen threw up outdoors), they ran a snake down the sink and after that put the sink back together however claimed they wouldn't take responsibility if it leaked now because of some undefined oddities in how my sink was put together. After they offered me the "do not put grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I observed they managed to reassemble the sink in such a way that the sprayer hose was twisted around the plumbing. I didn't even bother to try calling them back, since I never want to see this company again.</p>
