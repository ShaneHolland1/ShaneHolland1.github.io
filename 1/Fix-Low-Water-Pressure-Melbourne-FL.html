<p>Some makers declare that the electrical devices they produce can impact the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surfaces. Given that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one benefit claimed for the user is the removal of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant development promotion have been claimed, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just change the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of certain systems has revealed a decrease of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
<p>Throughout normal operation, the pressure in between the 2 check valves, described as the zone of decreased pressure, is maintained at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. The relief valve is created to open and release water to the outside if either check valve must leak. An RPZ will periodically discharge small amounts of water due to variation in line pressure up or downstream of the assembly. For this factor, the RPZ ought to be set up in locations that are exempt to water damage and enable adequate drainage.</p>
