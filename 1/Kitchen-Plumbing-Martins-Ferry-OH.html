<p>This is a great company with impressive professionalism, quality of work, and customer service. While their prices are incredibly competitive, their work does not feel inexpensive like some of the companies you can work with of off Craigslist or on a FB yard sale page.

<p>A minimum of when every 3 months, drain water from the tank. With time sediment builds at the bottom of the heater, which can obstruct efficiency, and draining a gallon or so helps remove the sediment. If you spot a leak and opt for a patching job instead of a repiping task, just remember that all the pipes in your home are most likely made from the very same product and they might be next. To avoid even more, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you might want to think about repiping your whole home when you spot a leak.</p>
