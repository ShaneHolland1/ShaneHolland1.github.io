<p>When choosing the correct system defense there are a number of considerations we need to take a look at. In my mind there is no one size fits all circumstances in the cross-connection world. Each and every installation must be taken a look at on a private basis as a distinct stand-alone system. The National Fire Defense Association NFPA 13 Standard for the installation of sprinkler systems contains the requirement for the lawn sprinkler themselves. Fire security system are developed to match the risk that exists in the areas they are installed in. As structure types and contents of these buildings can be extremely different, we need to comprehend that the fire security system for any installation needs to be created and set up to satisfy that particular danger or need. An airplane garage will need a very different fire security system than the system required in an apartment building. The backflow security requirements for these two examples would likewise differ significantly.</p>
