<p>A lot of homes or buildings that were built in the 1970s generally have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can start to corrode. This can trigger low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to offer weather condition security. As the external finishing of zinc begins to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, triggering the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
<p>Inspections are needed in a lot of states to ensure piping is at the needed depth. For instance, California has strict regulations relating to underground gas line installation because of earthquakes and other natural catastrophes. Piping should be at least 18 inches below ground for much safer locations and 24 inches for areas at higher threat of external damage.</p>
