Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively get used to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow need, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capacity. During durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's arguably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
