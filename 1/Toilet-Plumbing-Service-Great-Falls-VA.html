<p>Backflow means the unwanted reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable water supply; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a potable water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, however they should be thoroughly developed and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
