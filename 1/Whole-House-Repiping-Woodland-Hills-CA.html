<h3>Five Things To Do Today To Avoid A Clogged Toilet at Woodland Hills CA</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves should remain open and the system must be continually kept an eye on. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as easy as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm system that alerts the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems make use of both techniques. NFPA 13 describes all such devices as supervisory devices.</p>
