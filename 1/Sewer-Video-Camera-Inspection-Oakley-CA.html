Frequently the type and installation requirements are spelled out by ecological policies and local statutes.

Other laws can require the installation of more advanced and complex backflow preventers. And the design of these mechanical devices set up to avoid backflow range from the reasonably simple to the extremely advanced and complicated.</p>
