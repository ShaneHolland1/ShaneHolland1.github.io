<p>Wood pipes were used in London and elsewhere during the 17th and 16th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a little hole in which the water would travel through. 21 The multiple pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wooden tubes were commonly used in the USA throughout the 20th century. These pipes (used in place of corrugated iron or enhanced concrete pipes) were made of areas cut from short lengths of wood.
