<p>Nevertheless, due to the fact that a waste disposal unit is only expected to last between 10 to 12 years, a replacement will eventually be necessary.

When the motor stops functioning completely, another time that a replacement will be essential is.</p>
<p>The simplest solution might seem to be just neglecting the issue or using a do it yourself chemical option. However, this is a short-lived fix and may cause more damage.
