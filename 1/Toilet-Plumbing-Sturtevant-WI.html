<p>Water softener systems work by removing solidity minerals and changing them with salt ions. Water conditioners are devices that assist prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to prevent the scale from developing by reducing the effects of the hardness itself. Due to the truth that water conditioners use a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are often considered a greener option in areas where it is forbidden to use salt.
