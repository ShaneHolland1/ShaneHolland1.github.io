<p>Some manufacturers claim that the electrical gadgets they produce can impact the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Because these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one advantage claimed for the user is the elimination of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant growth promotion have actually been declared, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just change the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of particular systems has actually shown a reduction of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
<p>Pointer: Contact local codes before trying to install a garbage disposal. Some neighborhoods have plumbing codes that don't permit disposals since of limits on sewer capability.
