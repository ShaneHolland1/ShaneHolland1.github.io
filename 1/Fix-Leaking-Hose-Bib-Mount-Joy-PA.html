<p>The need for backflow preventers is apparent, but how do they work and which designs are best for particular applications? Often the type and installation requirements are defined by local statutes and environmental guidelines. Local building codes for instance will need a vertical separation of at least one inch to form an air gap in between a faucet opening and the greatest possible water level in its sink or basin. The resultant gap breaks any prospective siphon prior to it can occur, preventing contaminating water from being sucked back into the pipe system. Other laws can need the installation of more complex and advanced backflow preventers. And the design of these mechanical devices installed to prevent backflow range from the reasonably basic to the complex and extremely advanced.</p>
