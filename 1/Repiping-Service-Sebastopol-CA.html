He got our drain cleared out in a professional and really efficient way. I would not be reluctant to call Roto-Rooter for any future requirements.

It generally indicates there is an issue with the flapper, or the toilet is leaking water someplace.</p>
<p>A new pattern in re-piping is sand blasting the inside of used thin pipe and the painting the within the used pipe with epoxy paint. Often throughout the sandblasting the sandblasting will wear thin and blow through the wall of joints and pipes. Some of those thin areas leak right away and often those leaks come days or weeks later on. Leaking pipes that are epoxy-coated wind up needing to be properly re-piped by installing a CDA copper re-pipe.</p>
