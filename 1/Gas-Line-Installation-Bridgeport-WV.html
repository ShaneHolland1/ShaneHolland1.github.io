<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine proved successful, Sam Blanc developed and constructed a smaller sized model that ran on the same principle but could clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains as well as laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc also developed a much larger version of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It had to be towed by a truck and included a 10 hp fuel engine and 1000 feet of steel cable television. It was capable of cleaning large industrial and community sewer pipes. An improved variation called "The Mainliner" was presented in 1958 that could also thread telephone cable. It was terminated in 1973.</p>
