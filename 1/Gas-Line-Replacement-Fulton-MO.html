<p>The program accomplishes its objective by offering the adoption and promulgation of appropriate guidelines and regulations for the building and construction of plumbing facilities where mandated.

<p>Difficult water is softened by eliminating the calcium and magnesium it consists of.

Once the resin bed fills with hardness ions, it must be regenerated (cleaned). Salt is generally used in the regrowth process and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can begin again.</p>
