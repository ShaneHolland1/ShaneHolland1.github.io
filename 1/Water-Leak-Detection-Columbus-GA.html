<p>The Last Jeopardy answer, you ask? The device that regulates water circulation in your toilet. If you look behind your toilet, you'll see a supply line that ranges from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve. This is how water enters into your toilet. After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to refill the water in the toilet and the tank bowl, preparing the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the correct level, or isn't set up appropriately, you may experience a regularly or constantly "running" toilet - which can cost you numerous dollars in wasted water.</p>
