However, it adds a fair amount of functionality to the kitchen. A waste disposal unit is a reasonably small round device set up under the kitchen drain. When turned on, your disposal system takes down wastewater and any material particles by centrifugal force. But it does not shred such particles. Rather, it grinds it into a paste at high speed so that it can easily flow into the drain pipe together with the rest of your wastewater.</p>
<p>It clashes with the decor. If you're one of the lucky owners of an avocado green or coral pink toilet from years past, treat yourself to a toilet replacement.
