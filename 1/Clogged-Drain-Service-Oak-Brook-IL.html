<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large majority of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. Most home centers carry only one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest far more. Likewise measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet.

Even even worse, the line might collapse needing a significant repair or replacement.</p>
