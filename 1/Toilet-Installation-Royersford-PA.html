<p>Water softeners come in all sizes and shapes and bigger certainly does not mean better. WaterBoss ® uses great mesh resin - smaller sized beads that really provide more area to soften water. This resin is vacuum-packed to enable optimal capacity in a minimum of area. Plus, our patented Directional Circulation Screen system assists make sure that no resin bead goes unused. Our screens and whole-house dirt and sediment filter also safeguard the resin bed, so we don't need to lose space on freeboard" which is the empty area in conventional water softeners that permit a churning of resin during regeneration to launch dirt, hardness and sediment.</p>
<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the formula! To simply put some media inside a tank and expect the very best is typical in our industry and many companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other design on the market. Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under extreme temperature levels. It's just with the media and the fluidization properly interacting that you can accomplish this.</p>
