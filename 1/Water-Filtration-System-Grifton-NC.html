<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. A lot of home centers carry just one or 2 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest a lot more. If there's a door near the toilet, also measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with an elongated" design, the door might not close. Continue reading to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
