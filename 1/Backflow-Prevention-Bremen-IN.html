Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Typically, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to start with. Harder water will lead to more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in salt is small, but if you have actually been encouraged by a doctor to follow a stringent low sodium diet plan this increase can pose problems.</p>
