<h3>Emergency Plumber & 24 Hour Plumbing Services Freedom PA</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your company' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capability. Throughout durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's perhaps the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
