<p>The usual option is to have the faulty pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is a choice to think about if you live in an older house - such as one built pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for many decades, however steel ultimately suffers from corrosion and lacks the toughness these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
