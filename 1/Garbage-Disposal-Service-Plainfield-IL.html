<p>The majority of homes or structures that were constructed in the 1970s usually have galvanized piping. With time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can start to rust. This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to supply weather protection. As the external finish of zinc begins to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
