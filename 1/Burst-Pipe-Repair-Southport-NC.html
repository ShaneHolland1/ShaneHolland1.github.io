<p>Difficult water is softened by eliminating the calcium and magnesium it includes. When hard water travels through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (hardness) ions are eliminated through an ion exchange process, so just softened water travels through to your home. Once the resin bed fills with hardness ions, it should be regenerated (cleaned). Salt is typically used in the regeneration procedure and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can begin once again.</p>
<p>If you  wish to remove the salt, simply fill the salt water tank with potassium chloride pellets, not salt pellets. The only problem is that potassium chloride is costly: $25 to $30 per 50-pound bag. Salt costs $4 to $6 per bag.
