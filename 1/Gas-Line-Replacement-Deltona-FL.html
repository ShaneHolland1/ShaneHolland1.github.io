<p>Aside from these 2 important parts, there are a myriad of small, perhaps less important things that can break or deteriorate. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away far more rapidly. Consistent gross smells coming from the toilet can indicate you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising effectively, you may need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. If mishandled, tank lids can split and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed. While this will not impact the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by mentioning all the important things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total component and every part needs to be in great shape for it to operate at its best.</p>
