<p>After arriving after their window, they began to examine the kitchen sink (and after among the two gentlemen threw up outside), they ran a snake down the sink and then put the sink back together however claimed they would not take responsibility if it dripped now because of some undefined quirks in how my sink was created. After they provided me the "do not put grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I noticed they handled to reassemble the sink in such a way that the sprayer hose was twisted around the plumbing. I didn't even bother to try calling them back, considering that I never want to see this company once again.</p>
<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to make sure that liquids do not flow back against the required direction of flow. When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to ensure that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the local supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water kept in the sprinkler system can end up being polluted. If enabled to return to the water system, there is capacity for the infected water to become a health hazard. The backflow preventer is intended to prevent water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked routinely for efficiency, in addition to checked each year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
