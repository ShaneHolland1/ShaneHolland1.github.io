<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health threat for individuals on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Usually, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how tough the water was to start with. Harder water will lead to more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in sodium is small, but if you've been encouraged by a physician to follow a stringent low sodium diet plan this boost can present problems.</p>
