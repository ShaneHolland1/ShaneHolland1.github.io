<h3>Top Rated Atlanta Plumber Lebanon NJ</h3>
<p>Contact your local licensed RainSoft dealership today to get more information about the advantages of buying a water softening system for your home.

<p>Water softeners resolve a process called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the tough water participates in the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, usually made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, suggesting they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Considering that opposite charges draw in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is attracted to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the tough water travels through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the salt ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the firmness out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your home.</p>
