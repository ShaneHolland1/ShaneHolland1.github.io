Flushing the water heating tank must be done 2x every year. So, while a chemical drain cleaner may offer a fast fix in the short term, it can trigger much more problems, damage, and headaches in the long run. An excellent location to begin looking for the leaking kitchen sink plumbing unit is below the puddle of water or where you seem to feel the moisture most.</p>
