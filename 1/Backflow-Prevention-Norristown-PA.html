<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
