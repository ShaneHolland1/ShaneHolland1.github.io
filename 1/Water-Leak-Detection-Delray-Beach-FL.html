<p>The most efficient way to deal with difficult water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When difficult water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Tom of Gotelli Plumbing provided excellent service for us in changing a very balky tub spout, and broken toilet parts. Not only was he comprehensive and incredibly professional however he had the ability to address all my concerns worrying the service. I would give 6 stars if I could.
