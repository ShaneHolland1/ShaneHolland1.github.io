<p>Incorrect drainage slope: Drainage pipes are designed to take waste water away from a home and deliver it to the city's sewer system. Most do this using the power of gravity; pipes are sloped to drain water towards the street. If the drainage pipes are not set up at the proper degree of slope, drainage may not drain effectively and could flood back into the building.</p>
<p>Plumbers, steamfitters, and pipefitters often get injured on the job. Typical injuries include cuts from sharp tools, burns from hot pipes and soldering devices, and falls from ladders. With over 50 years of plumbing service under our belt, we have the experience and ability to take on any drain blockage, big or small. We will not stop until your drain is totally free and clear of dirt, grease, and debris. We likewise use hydrojetting to clean out those truly hard clogs.</p>
<p>If you  want to get rid of the salt, simply fill the salt water tank with potassium chloride pellets, not salt pellets. The only problem is that potassium chloride is expensive: $25 to $30 per 50-pound bag. Salt costs $4 to $6 per bag. A hydro jetter is a pump-and-hose system that utilizes high-powered water jets to clear residential and commercial drain pipes. Many high-pressure water jetters will operate with approximately 4,000 PSI of pressure and will push anywhere from 2-18 gallons of water per minute through a pipe.</p>
