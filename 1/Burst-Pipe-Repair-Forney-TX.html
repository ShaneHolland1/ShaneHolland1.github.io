<p>Standard tank-type hot water heater include steel cylinders that are fed by a water pipe that dips into a large tank. The water inside this tank is heated up and then launched into the pipes of your house through a hot-water pipe on top of the tank.

You'll also find a drain valve near the tank bottom, and a control system outside for setting temperatures and managing the pilot-light valve.</p>
