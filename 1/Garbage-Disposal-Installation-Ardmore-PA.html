If the P-trap under you sink is clogged, it can trigger water to construct all the way up your drains and produce a leak someplace along the method.

<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the equation! To simply pour some media inside a tank and hope for the best is common in our industry and lots of companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other style on the market. Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not stay with anything even under severe temperatures. It's only with the media and the fluidization correctly collaborating that you can attain this.</p>
