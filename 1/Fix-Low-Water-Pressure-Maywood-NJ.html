Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they should be carefully designed and installed to avoid backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
