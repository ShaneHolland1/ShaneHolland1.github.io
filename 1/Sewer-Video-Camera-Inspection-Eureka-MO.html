<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was quite reasonable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was very pleased with their service.</p>

Shower heads utilizing water treated by a water softening system, on the other hand, performed almost as well as on the day they were installed.</p>
