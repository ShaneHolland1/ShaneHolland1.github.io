<p>I had a major sewer issue with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might find on Google. I really got their number for another company that could not come quickly enough however referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me a quote. They right away cleared the initial clog, enabling the occupants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon additional examination, there was a substantial blockage that required excavation to investigate. His team was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial problem and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
