If your unit is outlet-ready-- pay attention to this part-- make sure your disposal switch remains in the off" position before you plug the brand-new unit in. While it's unlikely that having a disposal start up while your head is pressed versus it will cause decapitation, it may scare a couple of years off your life.

After they provided me the "don't put grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I noticed they handled to reassemble the sink in such a way that the sprayer hose was wrapped around the plumbing. I didn't even bother to try calling them back, considering that I never wish to see this company again.</p>
<p>I can't say enough good things about this company. Had a sewer repair required and had an extremely short amount of time due to closing on a home sale.

Friendly, communicated well, totally responsive and actually cared to help me through this really stressful task. All of the people I experienced were role models for what a well run service business ought to be. Much thanks and gratitude. You're great.</p>
