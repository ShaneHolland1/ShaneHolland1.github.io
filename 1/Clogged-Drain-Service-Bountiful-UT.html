<p>Drain pipe is not secured using the required solvent cement (end of the pipe need to be cut straight). ABS fitting is glued to PVC pipe. ABS and PVC are not really glued in the routine sense of gluing. The so-called "glue" is really a solvent that melts the surfaces of the pipe and fitting for a couple of seconds. Broken Pipes: Pipes are split, punctured or collapsed by moving soil, frozen ground, settling, and so on</p>
<p>Conventional tank-type water heaters consist of steel cylinders that are fed by a water pipe that dips into a large tank. The water inside this tank is heated up and then released into the pipes of your home through a hot-water pipe on top of the tank. Another pipe that emerges from the tank consists of the temperature and pressure-relief valve, which opens if you go beyond a preset level. You'll also find a drain valve near the tank bottom, and a control unit outside for setting temperature levels and controlling the pilot-light valve.</p>
