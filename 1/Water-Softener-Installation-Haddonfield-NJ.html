Initially, there would have been a cold and hot water line going up to the faucet (usually with shut-off valves for each) and a single drain pipe with a curved trap. Using liquid epoxy-resin solutions, trenchless specialists can cure in-place entire new areas of pipe within your harmed line, via little and even pre-existing entry points.</p>
