<p>Loose flanges are normally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws merely will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best option depends upon the extent of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood farther away from the flange. Prior to you install this type of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>
