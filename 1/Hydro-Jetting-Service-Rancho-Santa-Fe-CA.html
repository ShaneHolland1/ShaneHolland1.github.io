<h3>Emergency Plumbing Repair Rancho Santa Fe CA</h3>
<p>Backflow implies the unfavorable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean water system; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a drinkable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they should be carefully developed and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
