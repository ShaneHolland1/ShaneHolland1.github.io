Since these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one advantage claimed for the user is the elimination of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant growth promotion have been declared, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just modify the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of particular systems has shown a reduction of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" however rather "water conditioning".</p>
