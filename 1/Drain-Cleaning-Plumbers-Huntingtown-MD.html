However with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Most home centers carry just one or 2 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend a lot more. If there's a door near the toilet, also determine how far the bowl extends from the wall.
