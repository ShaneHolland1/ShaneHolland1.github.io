<p>The majority of houses or buildings that were built in the 1970s usually have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can begin to rust. This can trigger low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to provide weather condition protection. As the outer finishing of zinc starts to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, causing the iron to eventually rust.</p>
