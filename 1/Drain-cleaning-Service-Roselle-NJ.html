<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the equation! To just put some media inside a tank and hope for the best is common in our industry and many companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other design on the marketplace. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stay with anything even under severe temperature levels. It's just with the media and the fluidization appropriately working together that you can achieve this.</p>
