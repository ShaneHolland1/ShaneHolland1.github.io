This can be difficult, particularly when the backflow prevention assembly is installed inside an area where water can not be wallowed. It is important that the inlet valve be opened to flush this dirt and particles even if some sort of water collection system needs to be made use of to ensure the line is appropriately flushed.</p>
<p>When the water softening does not occur it could likewise indicate softener malfunction, or a problem with the salt that is used.
