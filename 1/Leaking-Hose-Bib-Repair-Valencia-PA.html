<p>Leaking gas can cause asphyxiation and hazardous explosions. Thankfully, commercial gasses, such as the kind a gas stove or heater uses, have a strong odor added to them so that leaks can be more easily spotted by house owners.

<p>When deciding on the appropriate system protection there are several considerations we need to look at. In my mind there is no one size fits all situations in the cross-connection world. Each and every installation must be taken a look at on a specific basis as an unique stand-alone system. The National Fire Protection Association NFPA 13 Requirement for the installation of lawn sprinkler contains the requirement for the sprinkler systems themselves. Fire security system are designed to match the hazard that exists in the locations they are set up in. As building types and contents of these structures can be extremely various, we need to comprehend that the fire protection system for any installation needs to be created and installed to fulfill that particular danger or need. An aircraft hangar will need a really various fire security system than the system required in an apartment building. The backflow protection requirements for these two examples would also differ greatly.</p>
