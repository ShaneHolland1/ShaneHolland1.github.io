<p>We had a terrific experience with Joe Boyette, he was very professional, polite, proficient. We had a lot of plumbing repair after a fire for over a 2 month duration. We also needed to replace a water and a bathroom heater unrelated to the fire, however we felt great in Joe's abilities. We decided to stick with Joe, although we felt Mr Rooter rates were absolutely on the high-end. This being published by Barbara Boyer from Atlanta.</p>
