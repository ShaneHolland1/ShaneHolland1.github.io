<p>Backflow implies the undesirable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean supply of water; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a safe and clean water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be carefully developed and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
