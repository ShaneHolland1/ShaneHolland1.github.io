When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is utilized to guarantee that water does not stream from the lawn sprinkler back into the community water system, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water held in the sprinkler system can become contaminated. There is capacity for the infected water to become a health risk if allowed to re-enter the water supply. The backflow preventer is meant to prevent water flowing back towards the main supply.
