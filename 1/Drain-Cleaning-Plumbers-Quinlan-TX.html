Cross-linked polyethylene (PEX) is the latest product being used to replace PVC pipes. It is typically used to replace copper pipes as well and is utilized for numerous other plumbing applications. PEX pipes are understood to be more heat resistant than other kinds of piping. They are considered safe and are frequently used to carry drinking water in new buildings.</p>
<p>Howard, the Task Supervisor, has constantly been informative and handy relating to all our issues. He did the proposition and scheduled the work for the clear out and partial sewer line repair immediately. It is always a pleasure to work with him. Derek snaked the laundry line and outdoors kitchen sink line which has a "Y". He was able to get a snake around the "Y", which numerous plumbers state they can't do, and clear the line. He is constantly enjoyable, professional and goes the extra mile.</p>

<p>Hard water is softened by getting rid of the calcium and magnesium it consists of. When difficult water travels through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (firmness) ions are eliminated through an ion exchange process, so only softened water passes through to your home. Once the resin bed fills up with solidity ions, it must be regrowed (cleaned). Salt is usually utilized in the regeneration process and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can start again.</p>
<p>Since the copper pipes have actually not had a chance to end up being coated within, New homes constructed with copper pipes are specifically susceptible to corrosive water conditions. As advised by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a new home for a period of 3 to five months after occupancy. This can be done by just bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's manual for instructions on bypassing your softener. Numerous brand-new houses are constructed with PEX and not copper.</p>
