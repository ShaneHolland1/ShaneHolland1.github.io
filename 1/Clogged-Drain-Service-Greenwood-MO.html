<p>Water softeners resolve a process called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water enters into the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, typically made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, suggesting they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Considering that opposite charges attract, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is attracted to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the tough water goes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your home.</p>
