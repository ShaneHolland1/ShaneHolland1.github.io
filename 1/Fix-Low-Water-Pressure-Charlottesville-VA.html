<p>IRWD is dedicated to providing safe, high quality water to consumers. Our comprehensive water quality program operates 24 hr a day, 365 days a year, to ensure that the water delivered to our clients is kept devoid of damaging impurities. A fundamental part of our water quality program is the backflow prevention program When a water line is linked to equipment including a nonpotable substance, this is called a cross-connection. Contamination may happen when water streams through a cross-connection from a nonpotable source, such as a lawn sprinkler or cooling and heating system, into the safe and clean water supply. This can take place through a procedure known as backflow.</p>
<p>While lots of water heater problems can be successfully repaired, some concerns will require total hot water heater replacement. If your water heater is past its regular life-span (usually anywhere from 8 to 10 years or longer if you have a tankless water heater) or if it has a significant leak or substantial rust, it may be time to consider replacement.</p>
