<h3>Emergency Plumber & 24 Hour Plumbing Services Stanley NC</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently get used to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation demand, tanks come online to include circulation rate capacity. Throughout durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's probably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
