I in fact got their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough however referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me a quote. They right away cleared the initial obstruction, allowing for the renters to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon further examination, there was a considerable blockage that needed excavation to examine. His team was on website the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial issue and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
