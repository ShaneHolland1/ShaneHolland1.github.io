<p>We Can Clean Your Drains. As the pipes continue to age, flakes of rust will accumulate in numerous parts of the plumbing system, most commonly in shower heads, faucets, and shut-off valves. This can cause low circulation concerns or even stop a fixture from streaming completely.

<h3>Plumbing, Drains & Water Cleanup Alexandria VA</h3>
<p>The most effective way to address difficult water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When hard water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Yes, anywhere connections are or can be made in between the potable supply of water and non-potable water or substances a backflow assembly is needed to be installed. An authorized, properly installed and maintained backflow assembly basically gets rid of the danger of backflow from either backpressure or backsiphonage. Make certain that the softener is filled with sodium or potassium chloride following the producer's recommendations.</p>
