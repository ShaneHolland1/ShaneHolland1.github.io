Blanc also built a much bigger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It needed to be pulled by a truck and included a 10 hp gasoline engine and 1000 feet of steel cable television. It was capable of cleaning big commercial and community sewer pipes. An improved variation called "The Mainliner" was introduced in 1958 that might likewise thread telephone cable. It was terminated in 1973.</p>
