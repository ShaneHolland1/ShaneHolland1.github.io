<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from typical circulation instructions within a piping system that is caused by negative pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the reversal of typical flow in a system brought on by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the water system piping). Back-siphonage can occur when there is a high speed in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is reduced main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as throughout fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>
<p>Hard water is softened by eliminating the calcium and magnesium it consists of. When hard water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (firmness) ions are gotten rid of through an ion exchange procedure, so only softened water passes through to your home. Once the resin bed fills up with hardness ions, it must be regrowed (cleaned). Salt is normally utilized in the regeneration procedure and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can begin once again.</p>
