<p>As a result of this electrical current, ions-- both favorably and negatively charged-- kind crystals that are suspended in the water. Scale and biofilm won't build-up, and the signal also chips away at already existing buildup. Hydropath Technology, which powers the HydroFLOW devices, is efficient and uniquely effective compared to other water conditioning choices on the marketplace today. With a HydroFLOW water conditioner, you're left with pipes, components, and appliances that are clean rather than covered in collected minerals and biofilm. This allows them to work to their complete potential and to last longer than they otherwise would.</p>

Regeneration immediately starts when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom home and household of 4, regeneration usually occurs every 12,000 gallons.</p>
