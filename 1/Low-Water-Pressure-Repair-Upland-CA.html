When your water lines are repiped, it just indicates old copper and galvanized pipes are replaced with new pipes. We discover that homes 15 years or older who have never ever had repiping work are the most likely prospects for water line replacement. You could be in need of water line repiping if you have an older house and are experiencing regular and major leakages.
