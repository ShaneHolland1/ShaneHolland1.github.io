The answer is totally depending on your distinct situation. For instance, if your pipe is experiencing a little leak but is in otherwise great condition, we would suggest fixing it. However, if the pipe is continuously leaking and needs regular repairs, we would suggest repiping. At Super Plumbers, we never ever advise services or products that would not really benefit the client.</p>
