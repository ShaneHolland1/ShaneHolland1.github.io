<h3>Bath Tub Repair in Fresh Meadows New York</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to only abandon the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost really quickly. This is the main reason why we will advise a complete repipe in certain areas, based upon our experience.</p>

<p>New houses constructed with copper pipes are particularly prone to corrosive water conditions because the copper pipes have actually not had a possibility to become covered inside. As recommended by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a new home for a duration of 3 to 5 months after occupancy. This can be done by just bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's manual for instructions on bypassing your softener. Many new homes are constructed with PEX and not copper.</p>
