<p>Since the pipes are much easier to gain access to and replace, it costs less to do the work and takes less time. Then, as your budget plan enables, we can attend to other areas of the home and gradually replace all of the pipes over a period of time, instead of at one time.

When it pertains to sink repair, we know what we are doing (having actually acquired over 50 years' experience in the plumbing business) and will want to help you out.</p>
<p>With time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, decreasing their capacity to soften difficult water. Through a procedure called regrowth, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a concentrated amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include a whole home water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener returns to service, offering the whole home with clean, soft water.</p>

<p>Water on the Floor or Discoloration of Flooring - If your feet get damp when you flush, that's not a feature ... it's an issue! If your linoleum floor is getting dark around the toilet, it might suggest a leak under the toilet. Hard water is normally not hazardous to one's health but can pose serious plumbing problems in both residential and commercial applications. From the lack of suds formation in bathing and laundry applications to the expensive breakdowns in boilers, cooling towers and other equipment that deal with water, water solidity is a major problem.</p>
