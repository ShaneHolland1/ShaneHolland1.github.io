<h3>Best Gas Tankless Water Heater - Indoor Vs. Outdoor Installation in Westborough MA</h3>
<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was rather reasonable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely delighted with their service.</p>
