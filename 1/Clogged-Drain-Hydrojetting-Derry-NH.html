<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to make sure that liquids do not recede against the required direction of circulation. When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to guarantee that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the municipal water supply, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water held in the lawn sprinkler can end up being polluted. If allowed to return to the water supply, there is potential for the contaminated water to become a health danger. The backflow preventer is meant to prevent water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected frequently for effectiveness, as well as examined annually by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
