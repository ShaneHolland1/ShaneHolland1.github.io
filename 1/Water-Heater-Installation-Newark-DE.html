<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge bulk of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. The majority of home centers carry just one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Likewise measure how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with an elongated" model, the door might not close. Read on to discover how to install a toilet.</p>
<p>The labor expenses for disposal installation are primarily time associated. If everything is prepared, in great condition, and the disposal is on hand and quickly put in, the plumber will likely just charge for an hour or more of time. If things need to be customized, replaced, or transferred to accommodate the disposal, this will take longer, and will up the number of hours needed and for that reason the total costs. A lot of plumbers charge between $45 and $65 per hour, with most disposal installations running $50 per hour for three hours total, making the labor costs approximately $150.</p>
