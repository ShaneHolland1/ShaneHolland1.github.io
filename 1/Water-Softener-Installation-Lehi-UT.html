<h3>Clogged Drains Driving You Crazy Never Call The Emergency Plumber Again Lehi UT</h3>
<p>The most effective method to address hard water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When difficult water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
