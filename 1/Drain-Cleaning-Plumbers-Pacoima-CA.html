<h2>Tips To Hire Plumbing Contractors in Pacoima</h2>

<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health risk for people on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral material. Normally, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how difficult the water was to start with. Harder water will lead to more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in sodium is minor, but if you've been encouraged by a medical professional to follow a strict low salt diet this increase can pose problems.</p>
