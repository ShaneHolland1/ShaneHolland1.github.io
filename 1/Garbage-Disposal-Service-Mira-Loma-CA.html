<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the equation! To just put some media inside a tank and wish for the best is common in our market and lots of companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other design on the marketplace. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under severe temperatures. It's just with the media and the fluidization correctly collaborating that you can attain this.</p>
