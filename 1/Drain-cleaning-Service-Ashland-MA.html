<h3>Unclog Drains, Toilets and Sewers With The Help of Plumbers in Ashland MA</h3>

<p>Clogged toilet? Leaking toilet tank? Need some repairs? Our group here at 1-800-anytyme can help. We understand that clogged toilets and other toilet problems are the very embodiment of inconvenience, which is why you desire them to work efficiently and have issues taken care of them as quickly as they arise. Repiping installers initially pick the materials to use for the job. Most of the time, copper pipes replace the main water and waste lines, and various kinds of plastic pipes will branch off from the copper lines to the components and fit into smaller sized spaces.</p>
<p>Remodeling plumbers generally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Again, this doesn't include the cost of parts. However increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their bids are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest a lot more. With this technique, you understand the turnkey rate going into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>
