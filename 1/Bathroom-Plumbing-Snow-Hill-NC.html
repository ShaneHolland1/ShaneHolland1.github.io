Harder water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in sodium is small, but if you've been encouraged by a medical professional to follow a strict low salt diet this increase can pose problems.</p>

Versatile gas lines are normally preferable to inflexible lines, especially in locations where earthquakes are more typical and for the connection between the supply and home appliance. Versatile gas lines are less most likely to be detached in a natural catastrophe which reduces the threat of a surge or fire.</p>
