<p>Plumbers charge $75 to $150 to install a gas line sediment trap. Sediment traps catch wetness and sediment so that they do not get in the control system. Unlike a drip leg, the flow of the gas is altered to remove any sediment. A sediment trap may be consisted of in a drip leg install. The City requires backflow prevention devices to be set up anywhere there exists a connection that could enable tainted water into the City system or private plumbing. These devices go through testing by a qualified backflow prevention assembly tester upon installation. In most cases, they undergo routine tests later on, as well.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, you also need to think about the age of your system.
