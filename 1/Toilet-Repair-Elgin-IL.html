<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the formula! To just pour some media inside a tank and expect the best is common in our market and numerous companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other design on the market. Fluidization is the crucial to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under extreme temperatures. It's just with the media and the fluidization correctly working together that you can achieve this.</p>
