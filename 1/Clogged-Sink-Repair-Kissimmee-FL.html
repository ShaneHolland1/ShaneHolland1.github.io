<p>This is especially common after returning from a trip or not utilizing your house's supply of water for an extended period of time.

We have a dedicated group of experienced, highly-skilled, and professional plumbers who are at the helm of fixing all types of sinks.</p>
<p>Obligation for installation falls upon the owner of the residential or commercial property or the co-op or apartment board. Owners and boards of buildings that are released an order by the DEP to install a backflow preventer need to submit strategies with the DEP within 30 days. If the DEP has actually not received accreditation from a PE, RA, or LMP that the backflow preventer is at least in the process of being installed within that time, a Notice of Infraction will be sent. Violators will be accountable for a civil charge of up to $1,000 issued by the Environmental Control Board (ECB). Continued non-compliance can ultimately lead to civil and criminal proceedings and actions, as well as the termination of water service to the building.</p>
