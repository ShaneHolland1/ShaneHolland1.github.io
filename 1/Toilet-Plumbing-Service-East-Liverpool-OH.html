<p>Drain pipe is not protected utilizing the needed solvent cement (end of the pipe should be cut straight). ABS fitting is glued to PVC pipe. ABS and PVC are not actually glued in the routine sense of gluing. The so-called "glue" is really a solvent that melts the surface areas of the pipe and fitting for a few seconds. Broken Pipes: Pipes are cracked, punctured or collapsed by shifting soil, frozen ground, settling, etc</p>
<p>Utilize the convenient self-service wrenchette to disengage the old system from the bottom of the sink if there's an existing disposal. It will suit the holes on bottom piece of the bracket. Twist the bottom piece clockwise while supporting the bottom to get it free. A number of homes in my community being repiped and have spoken to next-door neighbors about the problems leading up to this. Apparently it begins with pin hole leaks in the copper piping and can cause significant damage if the leak isn't found quickly.</p>
