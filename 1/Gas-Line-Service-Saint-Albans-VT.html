<p>The area under your kitchen sink has actually gotten more crowded for many years.

<p>During typical operation, the pressure between the 2 check valves, referred to as the zone of minimized pressure, is kept at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. The relief valve is designed to discharge and open water to the outside if either check valve must leak. An RPZ will regularly discharge small amounts of water due to fluctuation in line pressure up or downstream of the assembly. For this reason, the RPZ needs to be installed in locations that are exempt to water damage and allow adequate drainage.</p>
