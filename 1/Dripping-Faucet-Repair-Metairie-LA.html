<h3>Things You Should Do Before Seeking An Emergency Plumbing Repair Service Metairie LA</h3>
<p>Now wait a minute, some people say, doesn't the water pressure in the water system keep the watering water from going backwards? Yes, most of the time it does. However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow occurs. No, it is not a regular incident, but it does take place more often than you believe! Frequently it takes place during the night when you do not observe the water was off for a couple of minutes. An example is when the water company has to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or connect a new pipe. This makes building and construction jobs easily the most common cause of backflow problems. Fire combating is another typical reason for backflow. Fire trucks use substantial pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This frequently causes the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will take place in the surrounding areas.</p>
<p>The watering backflow testing season is from May to September. Irrigation backflow prevention assemblies must be evaluated by a certified backflow assembly tester as the water is turned on to guarantee correct backflow prevention remains in location to secure our drinking water during the watering season. Denver Water will send out a testing reminder notification one month before the yearly test is due.</p>
