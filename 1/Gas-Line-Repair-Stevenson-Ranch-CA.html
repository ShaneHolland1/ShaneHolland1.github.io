<p>Because the copper pipes have not had an opportunity to become layered inside, New houses developed with copper pipes are particularly vulnerable to corrosive water conditions. As advised by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a new home for a duration of 3 to five months after occupancy. This can be done by merely bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's handbook for directions on bypassing your softener. Many new homes are developed with PEX and not copper.</p>

<h3>Plumbing And Remodeling Services Stevenson Ranch CA</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adapt to your service' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow demand, tanks come online to add flow rate capacity. During periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's probably the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
