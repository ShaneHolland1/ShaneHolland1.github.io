<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health danger for people on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Usually, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to begin with. Harder water will lead to more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in sodium is small, but if you have actually been advised by a physician to follow a stringent low salt diet this increase can pose problems.</p>
