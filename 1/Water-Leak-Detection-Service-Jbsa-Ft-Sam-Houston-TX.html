Carrying happens when the inbound tough water follows a narrow path through the softener's resin bed and does not exchange ions with the resin, leaving your water unsoftened.

<p>Aside from these two crucial components, there are a myriad of little, maybe less vital things that can break or degrade.

If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising properly, you might need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. Tank covers can crack and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed if mishandled. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by pointing out all the important things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total component and every part needs to be in great shape for it to function at its best.</p>
