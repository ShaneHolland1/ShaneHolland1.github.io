<h3>Drain Cleaning Techniques in Mary Esther FL</h3>

<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast bulk of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Most home centers carry just one or more 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest far more. If there's a door near the toilet, also determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" model, the door may not close. Read on to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
