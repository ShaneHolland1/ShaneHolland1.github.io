<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine proved successful, Sam Blanc created and built a smaller model that operated on the same principle but could clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains along with laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc also developed a much larger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It needed to be hauled by a truck and featured a 10 hp gasoline engine and 1000 feet of steel cable television. It can cleaning big commercial and local sewer pipes. An enhanced version called "The Mainliner" was presented in 1958 that might likewise thread telephone cable. It was stopped in 1973.</p>
<p>To prep your unit for installation, you may need to attach a cable with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I attached a cord with a plug kit that I purchased individually from the disposal system. It's as basic as feeding the wires from the cord through the disposal and connecting them to the matching colors on the system with wire nuts.</p>
