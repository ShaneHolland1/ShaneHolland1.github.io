If not, slowly stir the resin throughout the backwash cycle to help separate the material. Also, fungis and germs also form mats in the resin that reduce its effectiveness. Sanitizing the water prior to softening or periodically cleaning the softener with chlorine bleach will remove these problems. However, read the maker's directions before including any chemicals to the system.</p>
