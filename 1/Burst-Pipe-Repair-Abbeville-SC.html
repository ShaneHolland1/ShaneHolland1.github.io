<p>Water softeners resolve a process called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the tough water participates in the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, normally made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, indicating they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Because opposite charges attract, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is drawn in to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the difficult water passes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is released. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it travels through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your home.</p>
