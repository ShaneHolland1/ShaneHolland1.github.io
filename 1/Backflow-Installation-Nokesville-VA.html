Discovering a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the job if you have an uncommon flush valve. To discover an appropriate replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware shop. (Turn off the water prior to eliminating the flapper.)

By having the anode rod checked routinely and changed as required, you can double the life of your water heater.</p>
<p>The toilet takes a truly very long time to flush. Here's how it works: During regular operation, the pressure between the two check valves-- referred to as the zone of decreased pressure-- is preserved at a lower pressure than the supply pressure.
