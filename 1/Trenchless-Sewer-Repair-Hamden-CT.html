When tough water goes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (firmness) ions are eliminated through an ion exchange procedure, so only softened water goes through to your home. As soon as the resin bed fills with solidity ions, it should be regrowed (cleaned). Salt is typically utilized in the regeneration process and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can start once again.</p>
