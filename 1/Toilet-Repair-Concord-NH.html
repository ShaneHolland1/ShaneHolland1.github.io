<p>After showing up after their window, they began to investigate the kitchen sink (and after one of the 2 gentlemen threw up outdoors), they ran a snake down the sink and then put the sink back together but claimed they would not take duty if it leaked now since of some undefined oddities in how my sink was assembled. After they gave me the "do not pour grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I discovered they handled to reassemble the sink in such a way that the sprayer hose was wrapped around the plumbing. I didn't even trouble to try calling them back, given that I never ever wish to see this company again.</p>
