<h3>Clogged Drains Driving You Crazy Never Call The Emergency Plumber Again Skaneateles NY</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were thought to be a better alternative to galvanized and polybutylene piping. Unfortunately, one brand name is experiencing a lot of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a great deal of oxidization. This causes cracks in the tubing that can lead to leakages. As these leaks happen, zinc is leached from the fittings on the pipes, causing them to degrade. Lastly, chlorinated water has been discovered to cause cracks in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the best service to all of these problems.</p>
