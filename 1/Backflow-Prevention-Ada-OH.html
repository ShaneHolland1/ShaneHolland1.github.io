<p>When your water heater starts to leak, you need to replace it fast. We'll reveal you how to install your own gas hot water heater in less than a day. Even if you don't need a new water heater right now, chances are you will within the next couple of years. Water heaters tend to last seven to 15 years. This article is likewise for you if yours is getting old. Replacing a water heater isn't tough if you're handy with standard tools and have a little experience soldering copper.</p>
<p>The easiest way to keep you and your household safe from the prospective dangers of backflow through cross connections is to not create cross connections in the first location.

<p>There are a couple of dead giveaways that will let you understand you have a gas line leak in your home, and it is very important to pay attention to them. The gas pipe may be punctured or harmed if you see a strong smell that resembles rotten eggs. You might also hear a hissing sound as the gas is leaving from the line, but that isn't constantly the case. If you smell rotten eggs, it is very important to take action quickly to prevent any serious problems and to keep everyone safe.</p>
<p>Although these house owners didn't feel fortunate at the time, it was certainly good timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe was in good enough shape to reline before the issue worsened. Waiting simply wasn't a choice. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a detached garage. At the least, it would have been a very costly alternative.</p>
