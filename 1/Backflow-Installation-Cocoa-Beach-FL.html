This enables the parts to move to their pressurized positions in a precise motion. When the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air must be removed from the body. A lot of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from vital areas in the assembly.

<p>A backflow preventer is a method or mechanism to prevent backflow. The fundamental means of avoiding backflow is an air space, which either eliminates a cross-connection or supplies a barrier to backflow. The basic system for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which offers a physical barrier to backflow. The primary kinds of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure principle assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the check valve assembly. A secondary type of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential double check valve.</p>
