<h3>Residential Plumbing Emergencies Issaquah WA</h3>
<p>Now wait a minute, some people state, doesn't the water pressure in the water system keep the watering water from reversing? Yes, most of the time it does. However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow occurs. No, it is not a frequent event, but it does happen more frequently than you think! Typically it takes place in the evening when you don't see the water was off for a couple of minutes. An example is when the public utility has to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or link a new pipe. This makes building and construction projects easily the most common reason for backflow problems. Fire battling is another common cause of backflow. Fire trucks utilize huge pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This frequently causes the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will happen in the surrounding areas.</p>
