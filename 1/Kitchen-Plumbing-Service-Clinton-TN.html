<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbing Clinton TN</h3>
<p>Like any household appliance, hot water heater require regular maintenance to run safely and effectively. Regular hot water heater maintenance can also extend the life of the device and help prevent other problems or unanticipated leakages.

<p>Water softeners overcome a process called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water participates in the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, usually made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, implying they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Because opposite charges bring in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is drawn in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the difficult water goes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the salt ion is released. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your home.</p>
