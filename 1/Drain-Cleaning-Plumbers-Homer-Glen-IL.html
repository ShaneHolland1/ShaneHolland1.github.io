If your unit is outlet-ready-- pay attention to this part-- make certain your disposal switch remains in the off" position prior to you plug the brand-new unit in. While it's unlikely that having a disposal start up while your head is pressed versus it will lead to decapitation, it may frighten a number of years off your life. Not that I would know from experience.</p>
