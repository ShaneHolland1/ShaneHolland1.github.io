<p>To identify which toilet valve is causing the problem, take a look at the overflow tube. If water is overruning into television, there's an issue with the toilet fill valve. If the water level is below the top of the tube, the flush valve is leaking, enabling water to drip into the bowl. That sluggish, consistent outflow of water prevents the fill valve from closing completely. We removed the fronts and backs of new toilets to show you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts won't look so beautiful inside. You'll find scummy surfaces, water discolorations and corrosion. But do not be squeamish-- the water is as clean as the stuff that comes out of your faucets.</p>
