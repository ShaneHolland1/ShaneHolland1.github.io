It can take a DIYer a great deal of time to locate and make basic repairs, so include that in the cost when attempting to deal with the problem by yourself. A plumbing inspection can assist to figure out whether you've got excess scaling within the pipes lowering the water pressure, or if there is a small leak that you don't understand about.</p>

<p>To prep your unit for installation, you may need to attach a cable with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I attached a cord with a plug kit that I bought independently from the disposal unit. It's as simple as feeding the wires from the cable through the disposal and connecting them to the matching colors on the system with wire nuts.</p>
<p>Single flush High Performance Toilets (HETs) utilize 1.28 gallons per flush. The current dual flush HET offered by Bonney will utilize approximately 1.1 gallons per flush.

Appropriate care and garbage disposal maintenance will keep it running long past its service warranty and keep your drain lines clear.</p>
