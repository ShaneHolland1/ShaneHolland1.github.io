<p>Tru-Soft Â® Solar Salt water Blocks are produced for the requirements of many water softener units. Current Review: Howard, the Task Supervisor, has always been informative and helpful relating to all our concerns. He did the proposition and arranged the work for the clear out and partial sewer line repair immediately. It is always a pleasure to deal with him. Derek snaked the laundry line and outside kitchen sink line which has a "Y". He had the ability to get a snake around the "Y", which many plumbers say they can't do, and clear the line. He is always enjoyable, professional and goes the extra mile.</p>
<p>Another choice is to utilize salt pellets in the salt water tank, but then install a reverse-osmosis water filter at the kitchen sink. The filter will get rid of salt from the water, which you can use for drinking and cooking.
