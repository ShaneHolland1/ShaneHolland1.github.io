<p>Fixing a leaky faucet looks like an easy task, however many times the situation can be deceptively complicated. In some cases it's best to call in a certified plumber to ensure the root cause of the leak is effectively identified and attended to the very first time, instead of making several trips to the hardware store and buying a variety of parts only to wind up exactly where you started, or even worse, creating an even larger mess.

<p>The source or location of a sewer problem identifies who pays for repair. The City is responsible for the general public right of way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another.

Easements (normally 10 feet wide) where main sewage systems traverse personal property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
