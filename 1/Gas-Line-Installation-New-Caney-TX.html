<p>You have galvanized iron pipes. I had Cost Busters replace a water heater tank and a main water shut down valve. They were prompt and very responsive to send me a quote which was extremely competitive. They were very professional and did an incredible task. I would absolutely call them again for my plumbing requires. Now, if this staining only appears when hot water is being used, then the rust probably exists within your hot water heater tank and not in your pipes. This is obviously still a problem that needs to be handled right away (you'll likely need a brand-new hot water heater) but not one that requires repiping.</p>

After they provided me the "don't put grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I saw they managed to reassemble the sink in such a manner in which the sprayer hose was wrapped around the plumbing. I didn't even bother to try calling them back, since I never wish to see this company again.</p>
