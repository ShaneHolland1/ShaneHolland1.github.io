<h3>Plumbing, Drains & Water Cleanup Winston GA</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were believed to be a much better alternative to polybutylene and galvanized piping. Unfortunately, one brand name is experiencing a lot of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a great deal of oxidization. This triggers cracks in the tubing that can lead to leaks. As these leaks take place, zinc is seeped from the fittings on the pipes, causing them to degrade. Finally, chlorinated water has been found to cause cracks in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the best service to all of these concerns.</p>
<p>Duty for installation falls upon the owner of the home or the co-op or condominium board. Owners and boards of buildings that are provided an order by the DEP to install a backflow preventer must file plans with the DEP within 1 month. If the DEP has actually not gotten certification from a PE, RA, or LMP that the backflow preventer is at least in the process of being installed within that time, a Notification of Offense will be sent out. Lawbreakers will be responsible for a civil penalty of up to $1,000 issued by the Environmental Control Board (ECB). Continued non-compliance can eventually lead to criminal and civil actions and proceedings, as well as the termination of water service to the building.</p>
