<p>Identifying if you need a water softener is a personal choice. A license is not needed for repairs which include just the working parts of a faucet or valve or clearance of blockages provided alterations are not made in the existing piping or fixtures. A normal water softener includes a tall, narrow water-softener tank, and a short, wide salt water tank. The softener tank is linked to the home's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube connects the brine tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose ranges from the softener tank to a nearby drain or drywell.</p>
<p>It's quite typical for debris to end up being flushed down our drains. Consider how often food particles, cooking oil and hair winds up in our showers and sinks. After enough time, these items may develop into blockages, which can block the circulation of water throughout a house. This can cause a number of problems, from nasty smells to water leaks and burst pipes.</p>
