<h3>Qualities Of Good Emergency Plumbers Douglas MA</h3>
<p>Backflow suggests the unwanted reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable water supply; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a potable water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they must be carefully developed and set up to prevent backflow.
