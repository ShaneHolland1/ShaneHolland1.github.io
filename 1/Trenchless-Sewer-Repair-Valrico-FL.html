I in fact got their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me a price quote. They immediately cleared the initial clog, permitting the occupants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon more examination, there was a considerable clog that required excavation to examine. His group was on website the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial problem and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed.
