<p>Backflow implies the unwanted turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean supply of water; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a drinkable water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they need to be carefully developed and set up to prevent backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
<p>There are numerous signs to keep an eye out for. 1) The surface area of the floor in one area is warm and even hot to the touch. 2) The dial on your water meter keeps spinning, even when all home appliances and components in the house have been switched off. 3) The water heater seems to be running all the time. 4) All this adds up to greater gas and water expenses, in some cases really quickly.</p>
