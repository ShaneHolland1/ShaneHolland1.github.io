<p>106.2.2 Ten-Percent Guideline, General. Within the building envelope including listed below grade, if less than 10-percent (nominal) of the existing piping for a fixture, sub-system, or system group is replaced, an authorization and inspection will not be required. If so preferred, this will not preclude the licensee from getting licenses and inspections for such work.</p>
<p>Maintenance is another factor to consider. While you can acquire designs with unique features that do everything however add the salt, you will pay for each extra function. The tradeoff will be cost for convenience and you have no longterm warranty that the unique feature will not fail. Depending on the water source, you may have to filter turbid water or decontaminate bacteria-laden water-all before it even reaches the softening unit. Finally, if you own a septic tank, you need to consider the additional load on your drainage field from backwashing and regrowth. Estimates suggest that about 50 gallons of water are utilized for each regrowth cycle. This might or might not cause hydraulic overload of the septic system.</p>
<p>Other signs you might need to repipe include rust in your water supply, low water pressure, and damp areas in your walls, floor, or ceiling. While these prevail signs that precede repiping services, they do not necessarily imply repiping is the only service.
