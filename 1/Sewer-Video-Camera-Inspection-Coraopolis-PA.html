<p>Water softeners resolve a procedure called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water participates in the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, typically made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, suggesting they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Since opposite charges bring in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is drawn in to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the hard water passes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is launched.
