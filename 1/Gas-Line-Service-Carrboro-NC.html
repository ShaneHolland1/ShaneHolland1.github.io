<p>Backflow suggests the unwanted turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water system; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from taking place. Points at which a potable water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, however they should be carefully developed and set up to prevent backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
