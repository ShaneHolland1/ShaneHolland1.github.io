<p>106.2.1 Repairing Leakages.

<p>Other pipe repair methods include our Pipe Pull method and pipe relining. The Pipe Pull technique interchanges harmed sewer or water lines with brand-new piping by the use of a small hole at the front and back of the piping run. The broken sewer line guides the new piping into location. All new replacement pipes have a projected lifespan of one hundred years and are code certified, chemical-resistant, root-resistant, and leak evidence. Another effective technique is pipe relining. Pipe relining basically gets rid of the need for broken pipe removal. By inserting a solidifying lining product which coats the inside of the existing pipe, a new pipe is produced inside the broken one.</p>
