<p>When selecting the appropriate system security there are a number of considerations we need to look at. In my mind there is no one size fits all circumstances in the cross-connection world. Each and every installation ought to be looked at on a specific basis as a special stand-alone system. The National Fire Defense Association NFPA 13 Requirement for the installation of lawn sprinkler includes the requirement for the sprinkler systems themselves. Fire protection system are developed to match the danger that exists in the areas they are installed in. As building types and contents of these buildings can be really various, we need to understand that the fire defense system for any installation needs to be developed and installed to satisfy that specific risk or need. An airplane garage will need an extremely different fire security system than the system required in an apartment. The backflow defense requirements for these 2 examples would also vary greatly.</p>
