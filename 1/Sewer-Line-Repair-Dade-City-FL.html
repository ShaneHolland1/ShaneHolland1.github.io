Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capability. Throughout periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's probably the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
