Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Finding a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the task if you have an uncommon flush valve. To find an appropriate replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware shop. (Shut off the water before removing the flapper.) You might not discover an identical match, but opportunities are you'll locate one of the exact same shape and diameter. If not, attempt a plumbing supply shop (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Products") or search online.</p>

Have your pipes examined as quickly as possible so you do not end up with a major leak.</p>

Bottom line: Tough water can make cosmetic and domestic cleaning items less efficient. This can lead to irritated skin and even a broken washing machine.
