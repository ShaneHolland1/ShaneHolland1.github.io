<p>In the typical repair, the old rubber parts should be removed and changed with brand-new rubber parts. When putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts, it is crucial that only initial factory repair parts are utilized.

<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable supply of water pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
