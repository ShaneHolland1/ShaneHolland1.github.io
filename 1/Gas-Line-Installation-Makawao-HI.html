<p>The upstairs main kitchen drain was clogged with a few years of gunk and had supported into the downstairs bathroom sink. Mr. Singh did a minimum of 3 attempts to clear the main drain, however the downstairs sink still had standing water in the bowl. Utilizing his knowledge and experience he identified that the drain system from the upstairs sink was clear however the backup was in the branch to the downstairs sink. With a little coaxing, much to my delight, the sink cleared and all the particles went down the newly cleaned main drain.
