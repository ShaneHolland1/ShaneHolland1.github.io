<p>You have galvanized iron pipes. I had Price Busters replace a hot water heater tank and a main water shut down valve. They were timely and really responsive to send me a quote which was very competitive. They were very professional and did an awesome job. I would certainly call them again for my plumbing requires. Now, if this discoloration only appears when hot water is being used, then the rust probably exists within your hot water heater tank and not in your pipes. This is of course still an issue that needs to be dealt with right now (you'll likely need a brand-new hot water heater) but not one that needs repiping.</p>

We renovate the task at no extra cost to you if any difficult spots stay. We had some family concerning remain for graduation weekend and we required a brand-new water heater prior to they arrived. We looked around for a bit, however we got the very best quotes from Blue Frog. They were able to send somebody out within a day approximately. He was great and really friendly. He said our bills should be lower now too.</p>
<p>At least as soon as every 3 months, drain water from the tank. In time sediment constructs at the bottom of the heater, which can hinder performance, and draining a gallon approximately helps get rid of the sediment.

To avoid even more, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you may wish to think about repiping your entire home when you find a leak.</p>
