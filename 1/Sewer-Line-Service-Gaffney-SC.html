Garbage disposals are pretty easy to maintain. The most crucial thing to keep in mind is that they are really food disposals. Items that would otherwise go in the garbage should not be put in your disposal. This consists of glass, plastic, metals (yes, silverware), paper, anything combustible, bleach, drain cleaners, and toys.</p>
<p>To determine which toilet valve is triggering the problem, look at the overflow tube. If water is overruning into the tube, there's a problem with the toilet fill valve.
