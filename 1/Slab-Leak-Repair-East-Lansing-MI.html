<p>EcoWater's elite water softener system is our conditioner, offered in a single-tank "cabinet" design. It is highly recommended for either local or well water products. No one wants to stroll into a kitchen or a bathroom and find a sink full of black gunk. We need our faucets and sinks to be working correctly in order to uphold safe and sanitary living conditions also.</p>

Bottom line: Difficult water can make cosmetic and domestic cleaning products less efficient. This can result in inflamed skin or even a broken washing machine. It's why many cleaning products today consist of chelating representatives or other kinds of water softeners.</p>
<p>To prep your system for installation, you might have to attach a cable with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I attached a cord with a plug kit that I purchased individually from the disposal system. It's as basic as feeding the wires from the cord through the disposal and attaching them to the matching colors on the unit with wire nuts.</p>
<p>Single flush High Efficiency Toilets (HETs) use 1.28 gallons per flush. The latest double flush HET used by Bonney will utilize approximately 1.1 gallons per flush. This is where we disagree with InSinkErator. We advise, as most plumbers do, to utilize disposals sparingly. Proper care and waste disposal unit maintenance will keep it running long past its warranty and keep your drain lines clear.</p>
