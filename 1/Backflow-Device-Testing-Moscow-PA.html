<p>We had a fantastic experience with Joe Boyette, he was really professional, courteous, competent. We had a lot of plumbing repair after a fire for over a 2 month duration. We also had to replace a water and a bathroom heater unrelated to the fire, but we felt great in Joe's abilities. We made the decision to stick with Joe, even though we felt Mr Rooter costs were certainly on the luxury. This being posted by Barbara Boyer from Atlanta.</p>

<p>The Last Jeopardy answer, you ask? The device that manages water flow in your toilet. If you look behind your toilet, you'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve. This is how water enters your toilet. After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to fill up the water in the tank and the toilet bowl, preparing the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the right level, or isn't installed effectively, you might experience a regularly or continuously "running" toilet - which can cost you numerous dollars in wasted water.</p>
