<p>If you see rust only in your hot water, then examine the status of your hot water heater's anode rod. If you've never done this on your own, you may need a professional to do this. The rust is most likely coming from the inside of your water heater if the anode rod is rusted out. If this is the case, replace your water heater as quickly as possible. On the other hand, if you see rust from both your cold and hot water taps, you probably have actually corroded piping.</p>
