<p>The source or location of a sewer issue identifies who pays for repair. The City is accountable for the public right-of-way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another.

<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health threat for individuals on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Typically, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to begin with. More difficult water will lead to more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in salt is small, however if you have actually been recommended by a doctor to follow a stringent low sodium diet plan this increase can posture problems.</p>
