<p>The need for backflow preventers is apparent, but how do they work and which styles are best for specific applications? Frequently the type and installation requirements are spelled out by ecological regulations and local statutes. Local building codes for instance will require a vertical separation of at least one inch to form an air gap in between a faucet opening and the highest possible water level in its sink or basin. The resultant gap breaks any potential siphon prior to it can happen, preventing infecting water from being drawn back into the pipe system. Other laws can need the installation of more sophisticated and complicated backflow preventers. And the design of these mechanical devices set up to avoid backflow range from the fairly simple to the very advanced and complex.</p>

If an GFAVB is utilized backflow prevention on an irrigation system you should install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It must also be set up at least 6 inches (150 mm) higher than the highest outlet in the system (some GFAVB producers, and some local officials, need that they be set up 12 inches (300 mm) higher than the greatest outlet). Some municipalities do not permit the use of GFAVB's. These systems will NOT prevent backflow pressure and can just secure versus back siphonage.</p>
<p>Next comes the metal mount ring and rubber cushion mount (or cushion ring). Their correct orientation will be identified. These 2 pieces have complementary grooves that when properly meshed hold the mount ring and disposal in place.
