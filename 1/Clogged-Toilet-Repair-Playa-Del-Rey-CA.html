<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the equation! To simply pour some media inside a tank and wish for the best is common in our market and lots of companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other design on the market. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under extreme temperatures. It's just with the media and the fluidization correctly interacting that you can accomplish this.</p>
