<p>When completion user opens a valve (faucet, sprinkler, etc), water streams in the regular direction from the provider, downstream to fill the user's need. The flow of water pushes the spring-loaded check valves open. The tension of the # 1 check spring maintainins the pressure difference in the Zone of Lowered Pressure. This difference in pressure keeps the relief valve in the closed position while water flows in the typical direction.</p>
<p>Without a structure license, your home owner's insurance coverage may deny a claim for damage triggered by an unsuccessful hot water heater. Health and life loss aren't the only adverse effects of a leaking gas pipeline; monetary loss is just as damaging.
