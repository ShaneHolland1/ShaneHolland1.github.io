<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not flow back against the required instructions of circulation. When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is utilized to make sure that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the municipal supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water kept in the sprinkler system can end up being infected. If allowed to re-enter the water system, there is potential for the polluted water to end up being a health hazard. The backflow preventer is intended to avoid water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked frequently for effectiveness, along with checked each year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
