It is practical to apply pressure on the flange from above using a 2nd set of hands or a heavy object. This will keep the flange in place while attaching the attaching system listed below.

Other laws can require the installation of more sophisticated and complex backflow preventers. And the design of these mechanical gadgets installed to prevent backflow range from the reasonably easy to the really advanced and complex.</p>
