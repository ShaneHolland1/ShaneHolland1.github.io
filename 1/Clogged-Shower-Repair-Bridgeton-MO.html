<p>The most reliable method to address difficult water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When hard water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>For gas lines that must be run under ground, a special kind of black pipe must be used that is covered with an unique plastic material that keeps the wetness out. This is so it is easily discernible from underground water lines, and likewise due to the fact that the plastic coating in fact secures the pipe much better than a galvanized finishing would.</p>
