<p>A water softener works by utilizing electrical charges to remove the minerals. Calcium, magnesium and many other minerals bring favorable charges, so water softeners use salt ions, which are "exchanged" with the calcium and magnesium ions. If you irrigate with drinkable water, you are needed to have two backflow preventers, one at the meter and another one on the irrigation line at the point of connection. If you have 2 meters, drinkable and watering, you are also required to have 2 backflow preventers, one at each meter.</p>

The piping in a pre-action system includes air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is kept back by the pre-action valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire occurs, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then permits water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>
