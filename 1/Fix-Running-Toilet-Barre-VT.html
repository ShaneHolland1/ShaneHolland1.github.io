<p>There are a few types of water heaters to pick from, each design has its advantages and disadvantages. The best one for you depends upon just how much hot water you use, and the heating method (electrical power, gas, oil). Some claim to reduce energy costs by up to half of standard storage models. The trade-off is that the preliminary costs are higher and your roi will take longer.</p>
