Continuous gross smells originating from the toilet can show you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising properly. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. If mishandled, tank covers can split and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by mentioning all the important things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total component and every part requires to be in great shape for it to work at its best.</p>
