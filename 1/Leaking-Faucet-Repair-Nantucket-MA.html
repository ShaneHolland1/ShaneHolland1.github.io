<p>Watering backflow gadgets are developed for installation on drinkable water lines to secure against both back-siphonage and back-pressure of polluted water into the safe and clean water supply.

Commercial assemblies should be tested every year.</p>
<p>The HydroFLOW water conditioner keeps minerals, algae, and bacteria from becoming an issue in your water supply by sending out an electrical signal of 150 kilohertz (kHz) through your plumbing system. The signal triggers the minerals to collaborate, forming clusters that eventually form stable crystals. These crystals do not hold on to surface areas like private minerals would.</p>
