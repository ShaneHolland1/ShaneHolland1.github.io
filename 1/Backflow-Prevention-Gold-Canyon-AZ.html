<p>Just like other construction employees, work of pipefitters, plumbers, and steamfitters is delicate to changes in the economy. On the one hand, workers might experience periods of unemployment when the total level of building and construction falls. On the other hand, lacks of workers might occur in some locations during peak durations of building activity.</p>
