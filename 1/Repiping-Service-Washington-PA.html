<p>I had a significant sewer issue with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could discover on Google. I in fact got their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me an estimate. They immediately cleared the initial obstruction, enabling the tenants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon more investigation, there was a substantial obstruction that required excavation to investigate. His team was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ‚Ä≤ hole. After repairing this initial issue and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
