The majority of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from crucial areas in the assembly.

The test procedure is a diagnostic examination of the functions of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer stops working to fulfill this minimum standard, the backflow preventer should be fixed or if essential, changed. These minimum requirements are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly begins to weaken in its performance, it can still avoid backflow. The purpose of a repair is to return the assembly back to its original factory working requirements. This means the assembly is fixed so that it can perform above the minimum standard.</p>
