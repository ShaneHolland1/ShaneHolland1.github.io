<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to just desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost very rapidly. This is the main reason why we will suggest a complete repipe in certain areas, based upon our experience.</p>

<p>Water softeners leakages are mostly caused since of a problem at the point of installation or because of maintenance. When installing the plumbing to your softener, take your time and ensure your fittings are threaded well and your push-to-connect fittings are seated appropriately. If the bypass valve is broken, it can also cause the system to leak. Bypass valves are fitted with -rings that might need to be re-lubricated or replaced gradually. A cracked rotor valve or rotor valve seal may also be the perpetrator. The rotor valve directs the water throughout the system during softening and regeneration procedures. A used water valve can lock up and spring a leak. If the rotor valve's seal is leaking, it is most likely cracked and merely needs to be replaced.</p>

<p>When pressure in a water system surpasses the pressure in the potable system providing the make-up water, backpressure is developed. This can force the drinkable water to reverse its direction of circulation through the cross-connection in between the two systems. Possible pollutants can then go into the safe and clean water system. The very best way to minimize build-up is have a professional flush it a minimum of when a year. In some areas of Virginia, where the water is particularly tough with high mineral content, you may need to flush the hot water heater more often.</p>
