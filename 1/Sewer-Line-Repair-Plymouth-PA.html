<p>Backflow threatens since it can contaminate the public drinking supply with impurities like fertilizers, pesticides, human waste, and harmful chemicals.

<p>Though water line replacement sounds like your house's equivalent of significant surgery, it's in fact something we at Gotelli Plumbing deal with regularly. When your water lines are repiped, it simply implies old copper and galvanized pipes are changed with new pipes. We discover that homes 15 years or older who have actually never had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement. If you have an older house and are experiencing major and frequent leaks, you could be in need of water line repiping. We discover that repiping can really be the less expensive and better long-lasting solution if you do have frequent leaks.</p>

<p>Although these property owners didn't feel lucky at the time, it was certainly great timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe remained in good enough shape to reline before the problem became worse. Waiting just wasn't an alternative. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a detached garage. At the least, it would have been a really costly option.</p>
