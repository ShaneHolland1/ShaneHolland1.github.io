<p>Now wait a minute, some individuals state, doesn't the water pressure in the water system keep the watering water from reversing? Yes, the majority of the time it does. Nevertheless, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow takes place. No, it is not a frequent incident, but it does occur more often than you believe! Frequently it takes place at night when you do not notice the water was off for a few minutes. An example is when the water company needs to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or hook up a brand-new pipe. This makes building and construction tasks quickly the most common reason for backflow problems. Fire battling is another typical reason for backflow. Fire engine utilize big pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This often triggers the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will happen in the surrounding communities.</p>
<p>Mechanical backflow preventers have internal seals, springs and moving parts that undergo fouling, wear or fatigue. Also, mechanical backflow preventers and air gaps can be bypassed. Therefore, all backflow preventers have to be evaluated periodically to ensure they are working effectively. A visual check of air spaces suffices, however mechanical backflow preventers need to be checked with effectively calibrated gauge equipment.</p>
