<h3>Blocked Drains in Michigan City IN - Various Tools Used</h3>

<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge majority of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. A lot of home centers bring just one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest far more. If there's a door near the toilet, also measure how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with an elongated" design, the door may not close. Keep reading to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
