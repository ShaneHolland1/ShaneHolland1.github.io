<p>If you experience blockages and backups in your home more than a few times, it's a great idea to have a professional evaluate your drain system. A drain expert like TLC will utilize a camera to inspect your drain system. Frequently, if you have numerous drain problems you might have a drain line break somewhere in your house or along your drain line to the sewer system. The camera can find and determine the problem so the drain can be repaired.</p>
<p>Softeners primarily eliminate calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions. Calcium and magnesium are frequently referred to as 'firmness minerals'. In addition, if your pipes are rattling, clanging, clacking and making more noise than they need to be (more than water streaming through the pipes), that's a substantial warning that something more serious is wrong with them.</p>
<p>Your disposer might feature a thin rubber gasket to be utilized under the sink flange, instead of the traditional plumber's putty as described listed below. Both will produce a great seal (though the gasket might result in percentages of water gathering around the flange), and what's used is mainly a matter of choice. Some even prefer silicone sealant, though it's harder to get rid of.</p>
