<h3>Things To Know Before Hiring A Sewer Cleaning Company at Mount Pleasant SC</h3>
<p>Bonney sets up energy effective gas hot water heaters and electric warm water heaters of every size to satisfy your needs. Bonney sets up 6-gallon to 100-gallon water heaters for residential use and every size hot water heater to fit your needs for commercial use. Position the disposal so that the discharge tube lines up with the sink drain waste trap and ensure all connections are tight.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge majority of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. A lot of home centers bring just one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Also measure how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" design, the door may not close. Keep reading to discover how to install a toilet.</p>
