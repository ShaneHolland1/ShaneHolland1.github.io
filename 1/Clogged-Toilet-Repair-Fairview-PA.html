<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not flow back versus the needed direction of circulation. When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to ensure that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the municipal supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water kept in the sprinkler system can end up being polluted. If enabled to re-enter the supply of water, there is potential for the infected water to become a health threat. The backflow preventer is meant to prevent water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked routinely for effectiveness, as well as examined each year by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
