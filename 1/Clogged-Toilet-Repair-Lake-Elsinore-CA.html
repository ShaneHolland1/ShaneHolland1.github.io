<p>As the water treatment industry has grown in the U.S., the principle of water softening has frequently been misinterpreted as a purifying, cleansing or conditioning procedure. This is due largely to overstated marketing and, in part, to consumer misunderstandings about water treatment. However the truth is that water softening just eliminates firmness minerals and eliminates problems that are a nuisance and not a risk to human health. The choice "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of individual preference not requirement. However, water softening does have advantages, and drawbacks, that make this decision a significant one.</p>

Some even choose silicone sealant, though it's harder to eliminate.</p>
