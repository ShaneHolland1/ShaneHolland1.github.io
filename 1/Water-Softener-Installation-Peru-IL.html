<p>Rust is a complex phenomenon and there are many elements that speed up rust in the drinking-water distribution system and property plumbing. For many years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and rust, making it important to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any factors that speed up deterioration Likewise, there is an absence of scientific evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is a reliable type of deterioration control. Therefore, considering all these elements, in addition to arise from research studies, WQA's position is that a correctly configured cation -exchange water softener does not make water more corrosive.</p>
