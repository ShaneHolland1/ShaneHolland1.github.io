<h3>Plumbing Drainage & Heating Grapevine TX</h3>
<p>Sewer lines can stop working for a range of factors, including bad soil conditions, obstructions from grease and gunk, and corrosion. Even bushes and trees can cause problems for sewer lines, particularly in older neighborhoods where clay pipe might have been used. In the cold Colorado winters, pipes can break from frozen ground, which can be doubly intensified if pipes have actually been permitted to freeze.</p>
<p>You have galvanized iron pipes. I had Rate Busters replace a water heater tank and a main water shut down valve. They were extremely responsive and prompt to send me a quote which was really competitive. They were really professional and did an amazing task. I would absolutely call them again for my plumbing needs. Now, if this discoloration just appears when hot water is being used, then the rust probably exists within your water heater tank and not in your pipes. This is obviously still a problem that needs to be handled right away (you'll likely need a brand-new hot water heater) however not one that needs repiping.</p>
