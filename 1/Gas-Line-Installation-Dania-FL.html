<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are devices that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. When the resin beads become full of calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium service removes the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride option becomes a waste stream that goes down the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
<p>When compared to gas models, electrical models are simpler and less costly to install as electricity is currently readily available through the main power supply line. For gas water heaters, a particular gas line needs to be set up and a viable source of gas established. Another feature of an electrical water heater is that they do not need any ventilation. Gas models need to be aerated appropriately using vents and ducts in order to function properly. With electric models, you will not have to install any new vents or ducts in your home.</p>
