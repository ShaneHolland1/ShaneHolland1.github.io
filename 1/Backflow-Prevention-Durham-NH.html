<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adjust to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow need, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capability. Throughout periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's perhaps the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>

Leaking pipes that are epoxy-coated end up requiring to be appropriately re-piped by setting up a CDA copper re-pipe.</p>
