<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a worn flapper is usually the culprit. But not constantly. Initially, look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing strongly if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with insufficient slack can trigger trouble too. Photo 3 shows how to set the slack perfect.</p>
