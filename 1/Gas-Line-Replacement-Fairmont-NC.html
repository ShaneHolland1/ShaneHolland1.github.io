<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems generally are installed in locations where water might cause devastating damage, such as in freezers, computer spaces, and areas with electronic devices. The piping in a pre-action system consists of air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is held back by the pre-action valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then enables water into the system's piping. The water is discharged through the open sprinkler.</p>

<p>A backflow preventer is a means or system to avoid backflow. The basic means of preventing backflow is an air space, which either eliminates a cross-connection or supplies a barrier to backflow. The basic system for preventing backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which offers a physical barrier to backflow. The principal kinds of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure principle assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the check valve assembly. A secondary kind of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential dual check valve.</p>
<p>A few of the causes of drain line clogs in kitchen drains are years of drain accumulation, a failing garbage disposal, or excessive food being disposed down the drain. We will generally advise our PowerSnake or ZOOM Jetting ® services, depending on the severity of the situation. Give us a call if your kitchen drain has raised water levels, is making gurgling noises, smells nasty, or is sluggish to drain.</p>
