<p>Trenchless Sewer Replacement Specialists: If you have actually had a sewer or drain back-up, opportunities are it's not the first and won't be the last. Several back-ups generally mean your sewer system is failing. We advise following up with a complete video inspection of the whole system to determine what is causing the issue and to figure out whether it will be a recurring concern. Whether it's degeneration due to age or roots discovering their way to water, we'll be able to see the issue and present you with your alternatives.

<p>A lot of houses or buildings that were built in the 1970s normally have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can start to rust. This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to supply weather security. As the outer coating of zinc begins to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
<p>Single flush High Performance Toilets (HETs) use 1.28 gallons per flush. The most recent dual flush HET provided by Bonney will utilize approximately 1.1 gallons per flush. This is where we disagree with InSinkErator. We advise, as most plumbers do, to use disposals sparingly. Correct care and waste disposal unit maintenance will keep it running long past its guarantee and keep your drain lines clear.</p>
