<p>I had a major sewer concern with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I started calling any number I could discover on Google. I actually received their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me an estimate. They immediately cleared the initial obstruction, allowing for the occupants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon additional examination, there was a significant blockage that needed excavation to examine. His group was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 â€² hole. After repairing this preliminary concern and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
