However, some materials tend to adhere to the pipe wall and produce a clog.

<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water supply pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean water system pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
