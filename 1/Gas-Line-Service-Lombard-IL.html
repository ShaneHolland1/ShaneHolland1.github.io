When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions.

That slow, constant outflow of water prevents the fill valve from closing completely. We cut away the fronts and backs of new toilets to reveal you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts will not look so beautiful inside. You'll discover scummy surfaces, water discolorations and deterioration.
