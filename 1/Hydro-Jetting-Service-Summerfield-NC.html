<p>State you choose to go that path. The next question is whether you can install it yourself. Put it in this manner, if you're a skilled helpful person, but you have actually never managed this particular repair, you can probably do it, supplying you do your research. I would draw the line at trying to install a power-vented gas-fired water heater (and some other customized designs).
