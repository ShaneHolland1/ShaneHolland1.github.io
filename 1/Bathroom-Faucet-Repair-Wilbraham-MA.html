<p>The list of things a food disposer can consume is relatively brief. Soft or crisp foods are great, but tough or stringy foods can be problem. Disposers can be dropped in their tracks by celery, eggshells and apple seeds, as well as the usual kitchen flotsam, consisting of pop-tabs, searching twist-ties and pads.

<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health danger for people on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Typically, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to start with. Harder water will result in more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this increase in salt is minor, but if you have actually been advised by a physician to follow a strict low salt diet this boost can present problems.</p>

<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was rather reasonable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly happy with their service.</p>
