If you experience regular problems with your plumbing, like drains clogging, this could be an indication of a bigger problem, like a tree root invasion or a large clog.

Small clogs can develop into big ones relatively rapidly.</p>

<p>The Last Jeopardy response, you ask? The device that regulates water flow in your toilet. If you look behind your toilet, you'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve. This is how water enters your toilet. After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to fill up the water in the tank and the toilet bowl, readying the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the proper level, or isn't installed correctly, you might experience an often or continuously "running" toilet - which can cost you hundreds of dollars in squandered water.</p>
