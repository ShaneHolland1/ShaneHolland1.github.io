<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the formula! To just pour some media inside a tank and expect the best is typical in our market and lots of companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other style on the marketplace. Fluidization is the crucial to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under extreme temperature levels. It's just with the media and the fluidization properly working together that you can accomplish this.</p>
