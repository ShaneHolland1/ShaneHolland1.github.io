<p>Then attach the waste pipe (and dishwasher hose, if appropriate). If your unit is outlet-ready-- take note of this part-- make sure your disposal switch is in the off" position prior to you plug the new unit in. While it's unlikely that having a disposal launch while your head is pushed versus it will cause decapitation, it might frighten a couple of years off your life. Not that I would understand from experience.</p>
<p>The labor expenses for disposal installation are mostly time associated. If whatever is prepared, in great condition, and the disposal is on hand and easily put in, the plumber will likely only charge for an hour or two of time. If things need to be modified, replaced, or relocated to accommodate the disposal, this will take longer, and will up the number of hours required and for that reason the overall costs. Many plumbers charge in between $45 and $65 per hour, with a lot of disposal installations running $50 per hour for 3 hours overall, making the labor expenses roughly $150.</p>
