<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water supply.

Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable water system pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
