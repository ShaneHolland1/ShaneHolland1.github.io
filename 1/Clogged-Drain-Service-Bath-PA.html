<p>You reside in an older house. If your home is 50 years old or older and you've never ever changed its pipes, there's a likelihood that you'll need to have it done soon.

If so, you may need to add a grounded outlet to power the waste disposal unit if you don't currently have one. This normally includes anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the total cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
