<p>The repair specialist should be able to recognize the many different producers and the particular models produced for many years. Some designs might appear similar on the outdoors but could need various repair parts on the inside, so the repair service technician must be able to determine the make, model and size of the backflow prevention assembly and any variations that might have been produced. Sometimes the identification number of the assembly will be needed to distinguish one design from another. It is important to know the correct model to guarantee you get the correct repair parts.</p>

<p>Remodeling plumbers normally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Again, this doesn't include the cost of parts. But increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily spend much more. With this method, you understand the turnkey price entering into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
