<h3>Water Heater Repair Services in Carmel IN</h3>
<p>SofTap's water softening innovation is appropriate for household, commercial, and industrial applications, consisting of the prevention of limescale accumulation in homes and scaling in commercial water treatment systems, in addition to improving existing reverse osmosis treatment systems. The technology is easier and more economical than other softening systems on the marketplace today that use zeolites, which must be restored utilizing salt water, or membrane nanofiltration that requires substantial water use and high pressure.</p>
<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in.. A lot of home centers carry just one or 2 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest much more. Also determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with an extended" design, the door might not close. Keep reading to discover how to install a toilet.</p>
