<p>Atmospheric Vacuum Breaker - Design GFAVB - The climatic vacuum breaker is among the least costly backflow prevention assembly. The GFAVB is a non-testable system and benefit back siphonage just for non-health threat or health danger conditions. They must be installed downstream from any turned off valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. If an GFAVB is used backflow prevention on an irrigation system you must install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It should likewise be installed at least 6 inches (150 mm) higher than the highest outlet in the system (some GFAVB makers, and some local authorities, need that they be set up 12 inches (300 mm) greater than the greatest outlet). Some towns do not permit the usage of GFAVB's. These units will NOT prevent backflow pressure and can only secure against back siphonage.</p>
<p>Water softeners work through a process called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the difficult water enters into the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, generally made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, implying they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Given that opposite charges attract, the negative charge of the minerals is drawn in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the hard water passes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the salt ion is released. The column of resin strips all the firmness out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your home.</p>
