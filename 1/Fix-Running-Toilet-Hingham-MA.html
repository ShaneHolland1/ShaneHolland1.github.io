<p>In many cases, our service technicians will advise that you replace your hot water heater rather than buy repairs. This is typically the case when the hot water heater is more than ten years old or the cost of repairs would total majority the cost of an entire new system. Sometimes a problematic toilet just needs a minor change and life is back to typical.

<p>A minimum of as soon as weekly, run warm water through the drains. This will clean them out rapidly and prevent any materials from solidifying to the side of the pipe. Brand-new water heaters include installation directions and lots of cautions to ensure you deal with the gas, electrical and other connections securely.
