Sewer pipes can be infamously tough to trace, specifically on older residential or commercial properties, so you'll want to employ someone who will trace the issue at its source.</p>
<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the formula! To just pour some media inside a tank and hope for the very best is typical in our industry and many companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other design on the market. Fluidization is the crucial to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under severe temperatures. It's just with the media and the fluidization effectively working together that you can accomplish this.</p>
