<p>There's no part of your house that has more of a direct effect on your safety, convenience, convenience, and reliability than your plumbing system. This is exceptionally important! When you have cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet supplies to push the waste out of your drain system. Present policies limit the quantity of water a toilet can use per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave particles piling up in cast iron drain lines. We provide two types of water treatment systems for difficult water: Benefit Series Seawater Softeners and NaturSoft ® Water Softener Alternatives.</p>
