When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is utilized to make sure that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the community water supply, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water kept in the sprinkler system can end up being infected. If allowed to re-enter the water supply, there is capacity for the infected water to end up being a health hazard. The backflow preventer is meant to prevent water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected routinely for effectiveness, as well as examined yearly by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
