Gradually sediment develops at the bottom of the heater, which can hinder performance, and draining pipes a gallon or two assists remove the sediment.

To prevent even more, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you might wish to think about repiping your entire house when you identify a leak.</p>
