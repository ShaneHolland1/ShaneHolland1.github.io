<p>Though water line replacement seems like your house's equivalent of major surgical treatment, it's actually something we at Gotelli Plumbing handle frequently. When your water lines are repiped, it simply indicates old copper and galvanized pipes are replaced with new pipes. We discover that houses 15 years or older who have actually never ever had repiping work are the most likely prospects for water line replacement. If you have an older house and are experiencing major and frequent leaks, you could be in need of water line repiping. We find that repiping can really be the cheaper and much better long-term option if you do have regular leaks.</p>
<p>Repiping is not a momentary fix. It's a permanent option for the entire plumbing system in your house or company. We shut off the water system, get rid of old pipe and replace it with brand-new pipe. After the new system is installed, we turn the water on and perform tests on the new system. When the system passes our tests, it's excellent to opt for you.</p>
