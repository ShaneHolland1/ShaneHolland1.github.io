Professional gas line contractors ensure the security of everyone in the house after installation.

<p>Water softeners overcome a process called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water enters into the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, typically made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, suggesting they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Given that opposite charges draw in, the negative charge of the minerals is attracted to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the hard water goes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the salt ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the firmness out of the water as it goes through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your house.</p>
