Scale builds up in your pipes, blocking them and decreasing water pressure.  Scale significantly shortens the lifespan of devices like dishwashing machines, coffee makers and ice devices. Tough water destroys hot water appliances. The higher the temperature level of the water, the more calcium and magnesium will solidify and harden into solid deposits inside your warm water heater.</p>
