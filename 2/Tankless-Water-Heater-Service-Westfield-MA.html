<p>When choosing the proper system security there are numerous factors to consider we need to take a look at. In my mind there is nobody size fits all circumstances in the cross-connection world. Each and every installation must be looked at on a private basis as a special stand-alone system. The National Fire Protection Association NFPA 13 Requirement for the installation of sprinkler systems includes the requirement for the lawn sprinkler themselves. Fire defense system are developed to match the threat that exists in the areas they are set up in. As structure types and contents of these structures can be very different, we need to understand that the fire security system for any installation needs to be developed and installed to satisfy that specific risk or need. An airplane hangar will need a really different fire protection system than the system needed in an apartment building. The backflow security requirements for these two examples would also vary significantly.</p>
