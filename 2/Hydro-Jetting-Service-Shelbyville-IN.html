<h3>Licensed Plumbing & HVAC Company In Shelbyville IN</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively get used to your service' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capacity. Throughout periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive flow innovation, and it's perhaps the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
