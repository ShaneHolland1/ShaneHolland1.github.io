<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their brand-new home and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to check the line and determine the cause of the problem. The line was clearly deteriorating; some sections were just held together by the ground around them. Another clog impended. Even even worse, the line could collapse requiring a significant repair or replacement.</p>
