As advised by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a new home for a period of three to five months after tenancy. This can be done by simply bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's handbook for instructions on bypassing your softener. Lots of brand-new houses are developed with PEX and not copper.</p>
