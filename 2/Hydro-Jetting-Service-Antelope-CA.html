<h3>Water Heater Leaking at Antelope CA? The Way to Diagnose and Fix the Problem Fast!</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves need to stay open and the system needs to be continually monitored. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as simple as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm that notifies the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems utilize both methods. NFPA 13 refers to all such gadgets as supervisory devices.</p>

<p>Although these homeowners didn't feel lucky at the time, it was definitely good timing to camera the line prior to collapsing.

At the least, it would have been a very costly alternative.</p>
