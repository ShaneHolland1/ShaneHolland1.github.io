<p>Recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line in between their new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we utilized our sewer camera to examine the line and determine the reason for the problem. The line was clearly deteriorating; some areas were just held together by the ground around them. Another clog loomed. Even even worse, the line might collapse needing a major repair or replacement.</p>
