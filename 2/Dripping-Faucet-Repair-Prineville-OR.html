<p>There's no part of your home that has more of a direct result on your safety, benefit, convenience, and reliability than your plumbing system. This is very essential! When you have actually cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet provides to press the waste out of your drain system. Current guidelines restrict the amount of water a toilet can utilize per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave debris piling up in cast iron drain lines. We offer two types of water treatment systems for tough water: Advantage Series Seawater Softeners and NaturSoft Â® Water Softener Alternatives.</p>
