<p>There's no part of your home that has more of a direct result on your safety, benefit, convenience, and reliability than your plumbing system. This is very essential! When you have actually cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet provides to press the waste out of your drain system. Current guidelines restrict the amount of water a toilet can utilize per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave debris piling up in cast iron drain lines.
