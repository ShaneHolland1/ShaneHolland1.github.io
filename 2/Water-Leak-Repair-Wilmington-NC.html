<p>Water softeners resolve a procedure called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water enters into the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, usually made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, meaning they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Considering that opposite charges bring in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is attracted to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the hard water travels through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it travels through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your home.</p>
