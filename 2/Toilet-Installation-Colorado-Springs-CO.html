<h3>Plumber Installation & Repair Service Colorado Springs CO</h3>
<p>We truly appreciate our customers and the services that we provide. As difficult water travels through a softener, the calcium and magnesium trade places with sodium ions (Figure 1). Sodium ions are held loosely and are replaced quickly by calcium and magnesium ions. Throughout this procedure, free" salt ions are launched into the water.

<p>When the information collected from the field test suggests the assembly has broken down in its efficiency listed below the established minimum standard, backflow preventers ought to just be repaired. The test procedure is a diagnostic examination of the functions of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer fails to fulfill this minimum standard, the backflow preventer need to be fixed or if necessary, changed. These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly starts to degrade in its efficiency, it can still prevent backflow. The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its original factory working specs. This means the assembly is fixed so that it can perform above the minimum requirement.</p>
