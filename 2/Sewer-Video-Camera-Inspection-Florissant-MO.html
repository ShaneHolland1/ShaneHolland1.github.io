<p>In water distribution systems, water is generally preserved at a considerable pressure to make it possible for water to flow from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure may stop working or be decreased when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is unexpectedly high demand on the water supply (for instance, when several fire hydrants are opened). Lowered pressure in the pipe may allow contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>

You could be in need of water line repiping if you have an older home and are experiencing frequent and significant leaks. We discover that repiping can in fact be the more affordable and better long-lasting solution if you do have regular leaks.</p>
