<p>As a locally-owned service, stability and duty are incredibly important to developing a reputation for excellence. One typical method for a home's water system to be infected is if the watering water lines, which might become polluted by pesticides or weed poison, backflow into the interior water lines. If that contaminated water were to backflow into the community drinking supply, the problem could spread tremendously.
