<h3>Tips For Finding An Emergency Plumber Wexford PA</h3>
<p>The most effective way to attend to hard water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When tough water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
