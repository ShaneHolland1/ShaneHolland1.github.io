<p>Nevertheless, UPC model code requires stand-alone residential systems utilizing non-potable piping materials to attain the exact same level of security as a commercial system. Increased protection is also needed when chemicals are contributed to a fire protection system provided by a safe and clean water system. If you have kids, remind them to avoid holding on any noticeable pipelines or playing with the outdoor gas meter. Holding on a pipeline may trigger it to come loose or break, launching gas into the home. The outdoor gas meter should be kept clear of any particles, such as plants or snow, so it is easily accessible in an emergency.</p>
