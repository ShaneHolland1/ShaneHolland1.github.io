When putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts, it is crucial that just initial factory repair parts are utilized.

The device enables water to push the check valves open when water is entering into the building, but closes them shut when water attempts to go the incorrect way.

There are a couple of others that I will discuss but do not get hung up on them. I discuss them just because they will be on a certification test.</p>
