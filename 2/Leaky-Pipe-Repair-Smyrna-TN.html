<p>Some manufacturers claim that the electrical devices they produce can impact the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surfaces. Considering that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one advantage claimed for the user is the removal of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant growth promotion have been claimed, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only alter the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of particular systems has shown a reduction of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
<p>Pre-action lawn sprinkler usually are installed in areas where water might cause disastrous damage, such as in freezers, computer rooms, and areas with electronic equipment. The piping in a pre-action system includes air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is kept back by the pre-action valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then permits water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>
