<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the formula! To just put some media inside a tank and hope for the best is typical in our industry and numerous companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other design on the market.
