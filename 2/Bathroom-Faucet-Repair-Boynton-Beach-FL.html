<p>Deterioration is a complex phenomenon and there are numerous aspects that speed up rust in the drinking-water distribution system and facility plumbing. For several years, there has actually been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and corrosion, making it important to compare naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any factors that speed up corrosion Also, there is an absence of clinical evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an efficient form of deterioration control. Hence, thinking about all these elements, in addition to results from research studies, WQA's position is that a correctly set up cation -exchange water softener does not make water more destructive.</p>
