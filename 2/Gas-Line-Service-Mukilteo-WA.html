After we have actually cleaned up the body, and the repaired parts are still out of the body, and we have completed all of our part replacement and cleaning, we need to open the inlet turned off to flush any rust or debris. This can be challenging, particularly when the backflow prevention assembly is set up inside an area where water can not be splashed around.
