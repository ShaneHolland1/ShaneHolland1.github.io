<p>When the end user opens a valve (faucet, sprinkler, etc), water flows in the regular instructions from the supplier, downstream to fill the user's need. The flow of water presses the spring-loaded check valves open. The stress of the # 1 check spring maintainins the pressure distinction in the Zone of Decreased Pressure. This difference in pressure keeps the relief valve in the closed position while water flows in the typical instructions.</p>

<p>Renovation plumbers normally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Once again, this does not include the cost of parts. But a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the component," and their bids are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily spend a lot more. With this technique, you know the turnkey price going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
