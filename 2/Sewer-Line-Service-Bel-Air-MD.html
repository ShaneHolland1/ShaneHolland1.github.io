<p>The most effective method to address hard water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When difficult water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>The sewer line in your home is a major part of your house's plumbing. Your sewer line is part of your water system that performs all water and waste from your sinks, drains, and toilets. Keeping tabs on the status of your system is a fundamental part of being a homeowner. Left unattended, sewer line problems can cost thousands of dollars in repairs and damage to your house.</p>

<p>Inspecting the condition, water, and age lines to the water heater can help plumbers comprehend lots of things, including water pressure and signs of leaks. If the water heater has been preserved with yearly flush service, it can likely last beyond its basic guarantee. All secondary sources of water, such as wells or plumbing systems that are exposed to potential contamination or poorer quality water, need a backflow prevention device.</p>
