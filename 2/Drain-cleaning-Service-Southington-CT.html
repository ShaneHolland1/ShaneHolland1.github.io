<p>Loose flanges are normally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws simply will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best solution depends on the degree of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Before you install this kind of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet.
