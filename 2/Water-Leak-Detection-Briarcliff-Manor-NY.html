<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to make sure that liquids do not recede against the needed instructions of flow. When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is utilized to ensure that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the municipal supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water kept in the lawn sprinkler can end up being contaminated. There is potential for the infected water to become a health hazard if enabled to return to the water supply. The backflow preventer is meant to prevent water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked regularly for efficiency, as well as examined every year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
