<h3>Plumbing And Water Heater Repair Lizella GA</h3>
<p>The most reliable method to attend to hard water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When difficult water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Yes, anywhere connections are or can be made between the potable supply of water and non-potable water or substances a backflow assembly is needed to be set up. An approved, correctly installed and kept backflow assembly essentially eliminates the hazard of backflow from either backpressure or backsiphonage. Ensure that the softener is filled with salt or potassium chloride following the manufacturer's recommendations.</p>
