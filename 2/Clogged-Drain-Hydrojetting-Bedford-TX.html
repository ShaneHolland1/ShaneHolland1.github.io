<p>Downspout Drains: These clog with leaves and debris and can fail to carry water from roofing system rain gutters far from your home or service when not appropriately maintained. Even if you take great care of your drains by covering them and avoiding pouring any liquid fat, oil, and grease down them, sometimes clogs are inevitable. If you have a clogged drain, it is extremely important that you do not attempt to unclog it yourself since this could possibly lead to a big leak and more expensive repairs.</p>
<p>Mechanical backflow preventers have internal seals, springs and moving parts that are subject to fouling, use or fatigue. Likewise, mechanical backflow preventers and air spaces can be bypassed. For that reason, all backflow preventers have to be checked occasionally to ensure they are functioning correctly. A visual check of air spaces is sufficient, but mechanical backflow preventers need to be evaluated with effectively adjusted gauge equipment.</p>
