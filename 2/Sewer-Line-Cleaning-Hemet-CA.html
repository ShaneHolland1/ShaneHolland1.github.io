<h3>Emergency Plumbing Repair Hemet CA</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adapt to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capability. Throughout durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's probably the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
