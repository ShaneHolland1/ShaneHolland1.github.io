<h3>Ensure Your Kitchen Sink Stays Unclogged With Three Easy Steps in Glen Head NY</h3>
<p>From showers and tubs clogged with hair and soap accumulation to sinks filled with toothpaste and other grime, restrooms present lots of challenges when it pertains to keeping drains complimentary and clear. Even toilets can be overwhelmed with toilet tissue or non-flushable products. Despite the obstacle, Roto-Rooter plumbers have all the equipment needed to attend to clogged bathroom drains and can supply professional sewer cleaning and drain cleaning services.</p>
<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large majority of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in.. A lot of house centers bring just one or more 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, also measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with an elongated" model, the door may not close. Continue reading to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
<p>In most cases, when you have a clogged drain or toilet, an auger is used to unclog the pipe and get rid of the debris. Depending on the intensity of the clog, or how far into your sewer pipe the clog lies, a high powered auger might be required.
