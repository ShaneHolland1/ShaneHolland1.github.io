Customer Detective Jodi Brooks called around to try to get an estimate from private plumbers for a waste disposal unit replacement. None of the businesses we called would give a quote over the phone. All of them wanted to look at the scenario before committing to a price, and all wanted to charge a service fee to come out. Brooks found only one plumber who would come out without charging.</p>
<p>We utilize quality items. In most instances, we try to utilize flexible carbon steel to carry gas from the exterior gas source to appliances. Versatile steel removes the need to cut and piece individual segments of piping together which lowers capacity for gas leakages.
