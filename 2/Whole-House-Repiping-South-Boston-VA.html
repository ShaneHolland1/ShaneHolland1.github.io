<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of one or more afflicted locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to only abandon the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very rapidly.
