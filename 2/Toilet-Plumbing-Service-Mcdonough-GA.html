<h3>Plumbing Repairs & Services In Mcdonough GA</h3>
<p>In the typical repair, the old rubber parts should be eliminated and replaced with brand-new rubber parts. When putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts, it is crucial that just initial factory repair parts are utilized. The rubber parts the maker produces for the assembly are the only ones the assembly was developed to use and changing the rubber from the original factory parts will affect the operation of the backflow prevention assembly and void any approvals.</p>
<p>Responsibility for installation falls upon the owner of the property or the co-op or apartment board. Owners and boards of structures that are released an order by the DEP to install a backflow preventer need to submit strategies with the DEP within 30 days. If the DEP has not received certification from a PE, RA, or LMP that the backflow preventer is at least in the process of being installed within that time, a Notification of Infraction will be sent out. Violators will be liable for a civil charge of up to $1,000 issued by the Environmental Control Board (ECB). Continued non-compliance can ultimately result in civil and criminal actions and proceedings, along with the termination of water service to the building.</p>
