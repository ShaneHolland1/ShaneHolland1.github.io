<p>Woodbury, along with lots of other neighborhoods and organizations, has discovered the very best method to avoid these stains from taking place is by reducing the number of times your water softener regrows. "Regrowing" describes the way softeners clean all the calcium and magnesium mineral deposits out of the filter medium when it ends up being "exhausted" or full. Nevertheless, many water softeners restore too often, when the filter medium really isn't full. This can be corrected by just resetting your water softener to eliminate less firmness or to run longer between regrowth cycles.</p>

<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of one or more afflicted areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to just desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason we will recommend a full repipe in particular communities, based upon our experience.</p>
<p>Drain cleanouts offer an entry point into your home's drainage system so blockages can be removed. They are typically white pipes situated outside your home however can be other colors. Cleanouts permit simple access into your drain system so when you have a problem a professional can get the rooter machine into the line to clear the clog or camera the line.</p>
<p>A water softener is a whole-house filtration system that gets rid of hardness-causing calcium and magnesium minerals from your water through a process called ion exchange.  A water softener addresses one of the most disastrous and widespread water problems: hard water.  Tough water wreaks havoc on the modern home. Scale builds up in your pipes, obstructing them and reducing water pressure.  Scale dramatically reduces the life-span of devices like dishwashing machines, coffee machine and ice machines. Tough water damages warm water devices. The greater the temperature of the water, the more calcium and magnesium will strengthen and solidify into solid deposits inside your hot water heater.</p>
