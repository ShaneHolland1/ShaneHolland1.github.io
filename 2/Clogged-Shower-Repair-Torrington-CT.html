<p>Home water softeners, likewise called ion exchange systems, are devices that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium.

After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride service becomes a waste stream that decreases the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>

If your house was built decades before that, possibilities are that your house might need substantial repiping so that your house's plumbing can work at ideal rates.</p>
