Here's everything you need to understand prior to rolling up your sleeves, directly from the pros.</p>
<p>New models of garbage disposals may need to be hard-wired into a devoted electrical circuit from the electrical panel; if this isn't available in an older house, employing an electrical contractor to include a circuit costs around $150-$ 250.
