<p>Hard water is softened by eliminating the calcium and magnesium it contains. When tough water travels through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (firmness) ions are eliminated through an ion exchange process, so just softened water goes through to your home. Once the resin bed fills with firmness ions, it should be restored (cleaned). Salt is generally used in the regrowth process and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can begin again.</p>

Extended warranty: Most disposals come with at least a 1-year warranty, but if you buy one with a life time warranty (15+ years), it will most likely be more expensive. While there's not a precise schedule as to when you should repipe your home, you must certainly look into repiping if they have not been done in 50 years or more-- especially if you live in an older house constructed closer to the turn of the last century.</p>
<p>With time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, reducing their capacity to soften hard water. Through a procedure called regeneration, water is automatically flushed through the water softener with a focused quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire home water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener goes back to service, supplying the whole home with clean, soft water.</p>
