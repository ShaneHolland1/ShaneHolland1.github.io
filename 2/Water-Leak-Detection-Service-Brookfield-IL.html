They use a physical media to hinder the scale from building up by reducing the effects of the hardness itself. Due to the truth that water conditioners utilize a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are sometimes considered a greener option in areas where it is forbidden to utilize salt. Water conditioners do not efficiently remove firmness from the water supply, however, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>

<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
