<p>Water softeners can be found in all sizes and shapes and larger absolutely does not mean much better. WaterBoss ® utilizes great mesh resin - smaller sized beads that actually provide more surface area to soften water. This resin is vacuum-packed to allow optimal capacity in a minimum of area. Plus, our trademarked Directional Circulation Screen system assists guarantee that no resin bead goes unused. Our screens and whole-house dirt and sediment filter likewise secure the resin bed, so we don't need to lose area on freeboard" which is the empty area in conventional water softeners that permit a churning of resin during regeneration to release dirt, sediment and solidity.</p>
<p>Eventually, however, the beads reach optimal capability and can't bring in anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank need to be regenerated, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank is available in. An on-board computer system computes the amount of water that flows through the softener. Regeneration immediately starts when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom home and household of 4, regeneration usually takes place every 12,000 gallons.</p>
