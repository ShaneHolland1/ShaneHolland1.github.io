<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned quickly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, giving off from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to remove debris such as hard water scale, silt, sand, and grease deposits.</p>

<p>There are a couple of dead giveaways that will let you understand you have a gas line leak in your house, and it is necessary to take notice of them. If you notice a strong odor that resembles rotten eggs, then the gas pipe might be pierced or harmed. You may also hear a hissing sound as the gas is getting away from the line, but that isn't constantly the case. If you smell rotten eggs, it is necessary to act quickly to avoid any serious problems and to keep everyone safe.</p>
<p>City of Bellingham inspects backflow assemblies upon installation and carries out periodic re-inspections on all existing assemblies. New assemblies need to be evaluated by a State of Washington certified Backflow Assembly Tester prior to putting into service. A copy of the test report need to be offered to the City of Bellingham. Your water will taste much better. The minerals in difficult water can trigger a bad smell and taste. When you include a water softener, it eliminates the mineral material to produce odor-free drinking water that tastes good.</p>
