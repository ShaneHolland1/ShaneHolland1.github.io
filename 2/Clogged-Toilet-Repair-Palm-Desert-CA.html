<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently get used to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capacity. Throughout durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line.
