A backflow preventer not only secures drinking water in private homes, it also prevents wastewater in private houses from flowing back out and polluting the public water supply.</p>
<p>The most common bathroom sink plumbing problem homeowners face is a clogged drain, from the accumulation of hair, soap residue, and even foreign items like bobby pins or cotton bud.
