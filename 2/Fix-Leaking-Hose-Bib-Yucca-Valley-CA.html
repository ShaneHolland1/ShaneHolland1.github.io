Dura PEX tends to have a great deal of oxidization. This triggers cracks in the tubing that can result in leaks. As these leakages take place, zinc is leached from the fittings on the pipes, triggering them to weaken. Lastly, chlorinated water has actually been found to cause cracks in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the best service to all of these concerns.</p>
