<p>After showing up after their window, they began to investigate the kitchen sink (and after one of the 2 gentlemen tossed up outdoors), they ran a snake down the sink and after that put the sink back together but claimed they wouldn't take responsibility if it dripped now since of some unspecified oddities in how my sink was assembled. After they provided me the "don't put grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I saw they managed to reassemble the sink in such a way that the sprayer hose was twisted around the plumbing. I didn't even bother to try calling them back, since I never want to see this company again.</p>
<p>So, if you want to stop having to jiggle your toilet deal with every time you flush and are sick and tired of publishing respectful signs in your bathroom everytime you have individuals over, get a brand-new trip lever that actually works for your toilet. While certain specialized flush valves or flappers might require a specific trip lever to work correctly, a lot of toilets will work simply fine with a "will fit" lever - which is good news for individuals who can't find their design number or who maybe have actually renovated or updated their components and desire a various surface or style handle to match the rest of their bathroom decoration.</p>
