<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of several affected areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to just desert the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost very rapidly. This is the main reason we will suggest a full repipe in specific communities, based on our experience.</p>
