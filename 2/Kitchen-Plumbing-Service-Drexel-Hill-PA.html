<h3>Plumbing - Leaky Faucets and Water Waste in Drexel Hill PA</h3>
<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was quite sensible. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly delighted with their service.</p>
