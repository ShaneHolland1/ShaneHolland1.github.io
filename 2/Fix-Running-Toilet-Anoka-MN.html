<p>. Backflow into a public water system can pollute or infect the water in that system (i.e., backflow into a public water supply can make the water in that system hazardous or unusable to drink), and each water supplier has an obligation to provide water that is functional and safe to drink under all foreseeable circumstances. In addition, customers normally have absolute faith that water delivered to them through a public water supply is always safe to drink. For these reasons, your water district should take safety measures to secure its public water supply against backflow.</p>

<p>Single flush High Effectiveness Toilets (HETs) use 1.28 gallons per flush. The latest double flush HET used by Bonney will utilize an average of 1.1 gallons per flush.

Appropriate care and waste disposal unit maintenance will keep it running long past its service warranty and keep your drain lines clear.</p>
