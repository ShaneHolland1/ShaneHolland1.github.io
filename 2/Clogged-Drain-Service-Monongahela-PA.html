<p>In the meantime, however, we recommend you very first try utilizing non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Merely put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. If that does not work, you can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. Many of these cleaners contain concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be extremely hazardous if it is available in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If using one of these items, please make sure to take the suitable preventative measures.</p>

<p>After showing up after their window, they began to examine the kitchen sink (and after one of the 2 gentlemen tossed up outdoors), they ran a snake down the sink and after that put the sink back together however claimed they wouldn't take responsibility if it leaked now due to the fact that of some undefined oddities in how my sink was created. After they provided me the "don't pour grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I observed they managed to reassemble the sink in such a way that the sprayer hose was twisted around the plumbing. I didn't even bother to attempt calling them back, because I never wish to see this company once again.</p>
