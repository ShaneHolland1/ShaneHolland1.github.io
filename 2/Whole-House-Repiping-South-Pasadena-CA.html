A single tank or cabinet-style system needs less space since the softener's salt water tank nests inside of the salt tank. The CareSoft ® system was developed with the very same advanced engineering as the Pro and Elite models, with resin that provides high-performance solidity elimination you can count on for many years to come.</p>
<p>In addition to the waste disposal unit unit, there are a number of upgrades and parts that you might need to think about when weighing the waste disposal unit installation cost. For example, a 2-inch service line connected to a 6-inch supply line will have the same pressure. If there is a break or high need for the water downstream from the 6-inch service line, then negative or decreased pressure in the 2-inch supply line will follow and trigger a vacuum or siphonage from the service line.</p>
