<p>All of the drains in your home, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your house then leave into the sewer or septic system from your home.

This can happen in several places and any mix of drains. For example, water might fill up in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are numerous mixes of this kind of backup. The point is your drains all connect, and as soon as you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overruning from numerous drain lines in your home.</p>
