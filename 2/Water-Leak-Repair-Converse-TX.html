<h3>Affordable Plumbing Services Converse TX</h3>
<p>The leak from a pipe fitting that costs less than a dollar can easily trigger countless dollars in water damage, disrupt your household for weeks, and throw your remodel way off schedule. So employing a licensed, insured master plumber (or a well-trained apprentice working under his license) is a no-brainer. But not all plumbers deal with all types of work. Their duties break out into 2 classifications: Plumbers who deal with basic repairs (often in emergency circumstances), and plumbers who concentrate on renovating additions and projects.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned up quickly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, giving off from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to eliminate debris such as difficult water scale, grease, sand, and silt deposits.</p>
