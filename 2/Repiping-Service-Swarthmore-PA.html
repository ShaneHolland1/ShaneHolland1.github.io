Then that generally indicates that your main sewer line is backing up when you experience blockages in several drains at when in your home. This can occur in multiple areas and any combination of drains. For example, water might fill in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are numerous combinations of this kind of backup. The point is your drains all connect, and when you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overflowing from multiple drain lines in your home.</p>
