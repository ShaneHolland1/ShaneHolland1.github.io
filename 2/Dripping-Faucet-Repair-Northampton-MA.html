<p>When selecting the correct system security there are several factors to consider we need to take a look at. In my mind there is nobody size fits all circumstances in the cross-connection world. Each and every installation needs to be looked at on a specific basis as a special stand-alone system. The National Fire Defense Association NFPA 13 Requirement for the installation of sprinkler systems contains the requirement for the lawn sprinkler themselves. Fire security system are developed to match the hazard that exists in the locations they are set up in. As building types and contents of these buildings can be really various, we need to understand that the fire security system for any installation needs to be developed and installed to meet that particular risk or need. An airplane garage will need a very various fire security system than the system needed in an apartment building. The backflow security requirements for these two examples would also vary significantly.</p>
