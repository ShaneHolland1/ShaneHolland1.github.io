<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the equation! To simply put some media inside a tank and hope for the very best is common in our industry and many companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other style on the marketplace. Fluidization is the crucial to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stay with anything even under extreme temperatures. It's only with the media and the fluidization correctly interacting that you can accomplish this.</p>
