<p>When deciding on the correct system security there are several considerations we need to take a look at. In my mind there is nobody size fits all circumstances in the cross-connection world. Each and every installation ought to be taken a look at on an individual basis as a special stand-alone system. The National Fire Defense Association NFPA 13 Requirement for the installation of lawn sprinkler consists of the requirement for the lawn sprinkler themselves. Fire protection system are designed to match the risk that exists in the areas they are installed in. As structure types and contents of these buildings can be extremely different, we need to understand that the fire defense system for any installation needs to be created and installed to satisfy that specific risk or need. An aircraft hangar will need an extremely various fire security system than the system needed in an apartment building. The backflow security requirements for these 2 examples would also vary greatly.</p>
