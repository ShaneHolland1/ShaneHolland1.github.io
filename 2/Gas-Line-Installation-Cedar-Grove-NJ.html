<h3>Plumbing - Leaky Faucets and Water Waste in Cedar Grove NJ</h3>
<p>What is difficult water? Clinically speaking, it is water which contains substantial quantities of dissolved minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey. Depending on the length of time the water takes a trip through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can get a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some regions than others. While the minerals will not harm your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and quite a nuisance-- for its many designated uses around your house.</p>

These designs connect to or replace your existing shower head to balance the pH of your water, stop scale from forming, and filter out minerals.
