I really got their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me a price quote. They right away cleared the initial clog, permitting the renters to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon additional examination, there was a substantial clog that required excavation to examine. His team was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole.
