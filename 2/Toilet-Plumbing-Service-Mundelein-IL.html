<p>As the water treatment market has grown in the U.S., the concept of water softening has often been misinterpreted as a purifying, cleaning or conditioning procedure. This is due mostly to exaggerated marketing and, in part, to consumer misunderstandings about water treatment. However the reality is that water softening just gets rid of hardness minerals and gets rid of problems that are a nuisance and not a risk to human health. The choice "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of individual preference not need. However, water softening does have advantages, and drawbacks, that make this choice a substantial one.</p>

<p>5. Pour warm water down your drain after using the garbage disposal - In order to get rid of extraneous grease that can clog your kitchen sink, rinse your drain with a little bit of hot water. Whether tree roots have made their method into your pipes or you flushed something you should not have, a clogged toilet is never a pleasant experience. Thankfully, you do not always need the support of a professional to fix it.</p>
