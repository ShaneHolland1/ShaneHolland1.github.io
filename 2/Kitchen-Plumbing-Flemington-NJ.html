<h3>Water Leak Detector in Flemington New Jersey</h2>
<p>The upstairs main kitchen drain was clogged with a few years of gunk and had actually supported into the downstairs bathroom sink. Mr. Singh did at least 3 efforts to clear the main drain, but the downstairs sink still had standing water in the bowl. Utilizing his knowledge and experience he determined that the drain system from the upstairs sink was clear but the backup remained in the branch to the downstairs sink. With a little coaxing, much to my delight, the sink cleared and all the debris went down the recently cleaned up main drain. By adding perseverence and perseverance the task was done to my total fulfillment.</p>
