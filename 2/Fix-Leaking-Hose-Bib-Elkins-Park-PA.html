<p>A lot of residential homes have roofing system rain gutters that stream into downspout drains that direct water away from the house. When those downspouts are linked to underground drains that circulation to local storm drains or street rain gutters, they in some cases end up being clogged with tree roots and debris. These kinds of blockages cause rain gutters to overflow and the weight of the water can trigger gutters to retreat from a home while causing water damage and rot to the structure. Please note that Roto-Rooter does not clean roofing seamless gutters or rectangular aluminum seamless gutter downspouts.</p>
<p>All piping under sinks and faucets are looked for leakages or damage. How to tell if you have polybutylene pipes: If your pipes are white plastic and include the letters PB" in the printed label, you have polybutylene pipes and we suggest having them replaced right away. Before you can ask for an inspection, you should first get the required authorization( s) for the work you intend to do. You can check out our Authorization page for more information on acquiring an authorization. As soon as you get an authorization you can begin with the work. However, you need to require inspection before you cover or hide any work.</p>
