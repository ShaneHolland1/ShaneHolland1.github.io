The hourly charge for a plumbing contractor is $72 to $82, which does not consist of materials or parts. Rates depend on the exact repair needed, where you live, hiring a plumber vs. working with a handyman, and whether or not you can DIY it.</p>
<p>A new pattern in re-piping is sand blasting the within worn thin pipe and the painting the within the used pipe with epoxy paint. Sometimes during the sandblasting the sandblasting will wear thin and blow through the wall of joints and pipes.
