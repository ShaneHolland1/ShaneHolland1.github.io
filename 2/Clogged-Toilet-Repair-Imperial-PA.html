<p>Water isn't hot enough. This can be discouraging because you might tolerate it for weeks or even months before deciding it needs to be repaired. Luckily it's normally a quickly, simple fix. We see this a lot on conventional electric water heaters, which utilize a set of electric heating aspects to heat the tank. Typically, one of the two burns out, resulting in water that's not hot but warm. We can replace it or diagnose the true issue if this isn't it.</p>
<p>Water softeners resolve a procedure called ion exchange which eliminates calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water enters into the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, usually made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, implying they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Since opposite charges attract, the negative charge of the minerals is drawn in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the hard water goes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the salt ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it goes through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your house.</p>
