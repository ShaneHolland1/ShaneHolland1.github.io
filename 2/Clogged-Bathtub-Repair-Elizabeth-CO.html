<p>Though water line replacement sounds like your home's equivalent of major surgery, it's really something we at Gotelli Plumbing handle frequently. When your water lines are repiped, it simply suggests old copper and galvanized pipes are replaced with new pipes. We find that houses 15 years or older who have never had repiping work are the most likely prospects for water line replacement. If you have an older house and are experiencing major and regular leaks, you might be in need of water line repiping. We discover that repiping can actually be the more affordable and better long-term service if you do have frequent leaks.</p>

Inspections called in on work not completed, not correctly installed, or on an inaccessible home will require re-inspection.
