<p>You already understand about the convenience and cost savings that they provide if you have a tankless water heater. Calcium rich water we gave here in New Orleans can reak havoc on the inner workings of your tankless hot water heater. Gas water heaters are cost-effective because gas is one-third the cost of electrical power. They are offered in Tank or Tankless choices. Tankless offers a great, stable stream of hot water for your luxurious baths and showers. Gas hot water heater are expected to last 10-15 years of great service with routine maintenance.</p>
<p>Water firmness is the amount of liquified calcium and magnesium in the water-- tough water is high in both calcium and magnesium. The reason you can feel the difference on your skin is because soap reacts with the calcium to form soap residue. This results in the need for more soap or cleaning agent to get things clean.
