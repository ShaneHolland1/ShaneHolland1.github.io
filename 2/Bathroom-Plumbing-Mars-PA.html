<p>To minimize the need of gas line repair, it's important to understand the common causes of gas leakages. Indoor gas leaks from heaters, stoves, ovens and other gas-burning home appliances take place most commonly in the winter. This is because homes are not sufficiently aerated throughout the cooler months to avoid heat loss.
