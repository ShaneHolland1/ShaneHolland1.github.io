<p>She understood about the service call cost. The 4 On Your Side Investigation discovered that's a typical fee. Consumer Detective Jodi Brooks called around to attempt to get a quote from private plumbers for a garbage disposal replacement. None of business we called would provide an estimate over the phone. All of them wanted to look at the circumstance prior to dedicating to a cost, and all wanted to charge a service fee to come out. Brooks discovered only one plumber who would come out without charging.</p>
<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health danger for people on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral material. Typically, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to start with. Harder water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in salt is minor, but if you have actually been recommended by a doctor to follow a stringent low sodium diet plan this increase can pose problems.</p>
