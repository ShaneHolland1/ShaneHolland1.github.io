<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine proved successful, Sam Blanc developed and built a smaller design that ran on the exact same concept but could clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains along with laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc also developed a much larger version of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It needed to be pulled by a truck and included a 10 hp fuel engine and 1000 feet of steel cable. It was capable of cleaning large industrial and municipal sewer pipes. An enhanced version called "The Mainliner" was presented in 1958 that could likewise thread telephone cable.
