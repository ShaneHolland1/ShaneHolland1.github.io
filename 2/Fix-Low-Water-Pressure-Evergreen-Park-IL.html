<p>Inspect the status of your water heater's anode rod if you see rust only in your hot water. If you've never done this on your own, you might need a professional to do this. If the anode rod is rusted out, the rust is more than likely coming from the within your water heater. If this is the case, replace your water heater as soon as possible. On the other hand, if you see rust from both your hot and cold water taps, you more than likely have actually worn away piping.</p>

<p>Backpressure is created when pressure in a water supply goes beyond the pressure in the potable system providing the make-up water. This can require the drinkable water to reverse its direction of circulation through the cross-connection between the 2 systems. Potential pollutants can then enter the potable water supply. The very best method to lower build-up is have a professional flush it at least as soon as a year. In some areas of Virginia, where the water is especially hard with high mineral material, you may need to flush the water heater regularly.</p>
