<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to just desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost really rapidly. This is the main reason that we will advise a full repipe in specific communities, based upon our experience.</p>
