<p>Find out if there are any lead pipes in the house. Residences that were built prior to 1986 frequently have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you know, no matter how useful, is an environmental toxin (note the need for unleaded gas and paint in homes that is not lead based).

<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the formula! To simply put some media inside a tank and wish for the very best is common in our market and numerous companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other style on the marketplace. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under severe temperature levels. It's only with the media and the fluidization effectively collaborating that you can attain this.</p>
