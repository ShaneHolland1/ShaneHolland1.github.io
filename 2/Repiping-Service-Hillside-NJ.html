<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a great guy. He informed me precisely what to anticipate (cost, time, process) in advance and delivered as promised. I will definitely utilize Clog Dawg again. Setting up a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with an average hourly rate of $25 to $70. These rates are in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. If your plumber has a minimum callout fee that is higher than the labor cost for the work, the total you pay may be higher.</p>

New meters need to meet regulations and code requirements for their positioning, and gas providers may require a special meter for their services, limiting your options. Design - Once you add a second floor and even 3rd floor, pipes need to be added to it. This is more complicated than plumbing the ground floor and is more labor intensive. Plumbing services will use more products which contributes to your labor costs.</p>
