<p>Surprise water leaks are frequently stressful and have Possibly Serious Consequences. Replacing your flapper might need a little different steps than we reveal (Pictures 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an uncommon flush valve, finding a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the job. To discover an ideal replacement, turn off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware shop. (Turn off the water prior to removing the flapper.)
