<p>To figure out which toilet valve is causing the problem, take a look at the overflow tube. There's an issue with the toilet fill valve if water is overruning into the tube. If the water level is listed below the top of the tube, the flush valve is leaking, permitting water to trickle into the bowl. That slow, constant outflow of water prevents the fill valve from closing completely. We cut away the fronts and backs of new toilets to show you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts won't look so pristine inside. You'll discover scummy surfaces, water stains and corrosion.
