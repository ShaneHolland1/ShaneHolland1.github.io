While the majority of kitchen sink disposers can deal with nearly any type of food waste, they are not unbreakable.

Worn impellers on older disposals can end up being ineffective, increasing the risk of drain clogs.</p>

<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the formula! To just pour some media inside a tank and wish for the very best is common in our industry and many companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other design on the marketplace. Fluidization is the crucial to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under severe temperature levels. It's only with the media and the fluidization effectively working together that you can achieve this.</p>
