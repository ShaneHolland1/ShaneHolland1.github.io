<p>A backflow preventer is a way or mechanism to avoid backflow. The fundamental means of avoiding backflow is an air space, which either eliminates a cross-connection or provides a barrier to backflow. The standard system for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which supplies a physical barrier to backflow. The principal kinds of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure concept assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the check valve assembly. A secondary kind of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential double check valve.</p>
<p>A double check backflow preventer features two spring-loaded check assemblies to prevent back and back siphonage pressure on non-health threat (low danger) systems. Unscrew the coupling nut that links the supply line. If the toilet valve turns inside the toilet tank, hold its base with a locking pliers. Idea: Throw a towel on the floor beneath to catch water that will drain from the line.</p>
