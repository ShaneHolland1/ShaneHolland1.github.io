<p>Liners are another popular item sewer cleaners sell these days. A liner is a fabric tube covered on one side with a layer of PVC, which is embedded with a two-part epoxy resin. Provider then normally blow the liner into an existing pipe. If your house was constructed prior to the 1970s or hasn't been renovated, you will most likely have old pipes that need changing.</p>
<p>Even if you think you can handle it on your own, you most likely do not have a camera suitable for identifying the reason for obstruction around bends in your pipes. You may even have a drain snake helpful, but when's the last time you used it-- and are you sure you're doing it right? Sometimes the very best thing you can do for your home is call someone with the right tools and know-how to fix your problem rapidly and efficiently. For Tewksbury, Andover, Billerica, and neighboring communities, Gregory Ostroski Plumbing and Heating is typically the first service provider individuals call for a drain cleaning service that works and is easy on their pipes.</p>
<p>Recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line in between their brand-new home and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to check the line and determine the reason for the problem. The line was plainly degrading; some areas were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog impended. Even worse, the line might collapse requiring a major repair or replacement.</p>
