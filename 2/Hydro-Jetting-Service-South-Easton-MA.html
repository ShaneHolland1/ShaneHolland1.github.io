If things need to be customized, replaced, or moved to accommodate the disposal, this will take longer, and will up the variety of hours needed and for that reason the overall costs. A lot of plumbers charge in between $45 and $65 per hour, with the majority of disposal setups running $50 per hour for three hours overall, making the labor costs approximately $150.</p>
