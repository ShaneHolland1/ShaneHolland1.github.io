<p>When lime is added to the water, it changes the water chemistry, triggering the calcium to come out of the option. The particles of calcium integrate, end up being heavier than the remainder of the water and sink to the bottom of the holding basins. The clear water then moves into the next step of the treatment process. Versatile gas lines are generally preferable to inflexible lines, particularly in areas where earthquakes are more typical and for the connection between the supply and home appliance. Flexible gas lines are less most likely to be disconnected in a natural catastrophe which reduces the threat of a surge or fire.</p>
