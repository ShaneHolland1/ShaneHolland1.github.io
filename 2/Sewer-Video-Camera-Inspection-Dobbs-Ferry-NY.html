A typical water softener includes a high, narrow water-softener tank, and a brief, wide salt water tank. The softener tank is linked to the home's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube links the salt water tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose runs from the softener tank to a close-by drainpipe or drywell.</p>
<p>Water softening describes the removal of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular technique of water softening is through a procedure called ion exchange. Throughout ion exchange, mineral ions are traded for another kind of ion-- usually salt.
