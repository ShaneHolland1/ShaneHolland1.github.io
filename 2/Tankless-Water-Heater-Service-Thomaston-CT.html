<p>The need for backflow preventers is obvious, but how do they work and which styles are best for particular applications? Frequently the type and installation requirements are spelled out by local statutes and ecological regulations. Local building codes for example will need a vertical separation of at least one inch to form an air gap between a faucet opening and the highest possible water level in its sink or basin. The resultant gap breaks any potential siphon before it can occur, avoiding contaminating water from being sucked back into the pipe system. Other laws can require the installation of more advanced and complicated backflow preventers. And the style of these mechanical devices installed to prevent backflow variety from the relatively simple to the complicated and extremely advanced.</p>
