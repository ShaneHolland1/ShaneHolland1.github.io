<p>Figuring out if you need a water softener is an individual choice. An authorization is not needed for repairs which involve just the working parts of a faucet or valve or clearance of stoppages offered alterations are not made in the existing piping or components. A typical water softener includes a tall, narrow water-softener tank, and a short, large brine tank. The softener tank is linked to the home's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube connects the salt water tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose ranges from the softener tank to a neighboring drainpipe or drywell.</p>
<p>Positive-Action Brine Valve - Snap-together construction removes use of solvents that may pollute water. Favorable action helps avoid overfilling. In your home, so much water washes through the drains, in addition to dirt, particles, hair, and other particles. Over time, this can all build up.

Unseen sets of pipes use pressure to move water through supply lines and out faucets, showerheads or into your toilet. In a separate drain path, little pipes run from the tub and sink to eventually meet up with a larger one underneath the toilet, carrying waste and wastewater from the bathroom and eventually out of the home.</p>

<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a worn flapper is normally the offender. But not constantly. Initially, look at the chain that raises the flapper.
