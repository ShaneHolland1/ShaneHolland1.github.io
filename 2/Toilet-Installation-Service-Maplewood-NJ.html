<h3>Residential Plumbing Services Maplewood NJ</h3>
<p>Water isn't hot enough. This can be frustrating due to the fact that you might bear with it for weeks or even months before choosing it needs to be repaired. Thankfully it's usually a quick, simple fix. We see this a lot on conventional electric hot water heater, which utilize a pair of electrical heating elements to heat up the tank. Typically, among the two stress out, leading to water that's warm but not hot. We can replace it or diagnose the true issue if this isn't it.</p>
<p>Water softeners overcome a process called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water enters into the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, generally made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, meaning they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Because opposite charges attract, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is attracted to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the difficult water passes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the salt ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your house.</p>
