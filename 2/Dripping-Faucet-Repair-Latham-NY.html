<p>Even for a non-steel plumbing system, age will eventually take its toll. If you discover that your plumbing suffers from many blockages, leakages, and water pressure fluctuation that no amount of repairs appears to stem, you need to seek advice from a reliable plumber about whole-house repiping as a service. Homeowners need to examine water pressure entering into their house on a regular basis. Water pressure should be about 55 to 60 PSI; some city water pressure can come in at over 100 PSI.</p>
<p>The system has actually returned to an absolutely no demand condition (no valves open downstream). However, debris between the # 1 Check Valve seat and sealing disc, or damage in the elements, is preventing the # 1 Inspect from closing all the way. This permits pressure to adjust in between the Supply Side and the Zone of Decreased Pressure. When this happens, the Relief Valve Spring presses back versus the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the RV Discharge.</p>
<p>City of Bellingham inspects backflow assemblies upon installation and performs routine re-inspections on all existing assemblies. New assemblies need to be evaluated by a State of Washington certified Backflow Assembly Tester prior to taking into service. A copy of the test report should be provided to the City of Bellingham. Your water will taste better. The minerals in hard water can trigger a bad odor and taste. When you add a water softener, it removes the mineral material to produce odorless drinking water that tastes excellent.</p>
