<p>Water softeners resolve a procedure called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water participates in the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, generally made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, suggesting they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Since opposite charges attract, the negative charge of the minerals is attracted to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the hard water goes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the salt ion is released. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it travels through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your home.</p>

<p>Rust is a complex phenomenon and there are numerous aspects that accelerate deterioration in the drinking-water distribution system and facility plumbing.
