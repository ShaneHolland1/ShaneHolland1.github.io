<p>The need for backflow preventers is obvious, but how do they work and which styles are best for particular applications? Typically the type and installation requirements are defined by local statutes and environmental policies. Local building codes for example will require a vertical separation of a minimum of one inch to form an air space between a faucet opening and the highest possible water level in its sink or basin. The resultant space breaks any possible siphon before it can take place, avoiding infecting water from being sucked back into the pipe system. Other laws can need the installation of more sophisticated and complicated backflow preventers.
