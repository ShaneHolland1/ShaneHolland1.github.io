<p>I had a significant sewer problem with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could discover on Google. I really got their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me a price quote. They immediately cleared the initial blockage, enabling the occupants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon further investigation, there was a significant obstruction that required excavation to examine. His group was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary concern and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
