<p>The heating element is taking longer to warm the water than it should if the water feels warm. However this particular problem is when you have no hot water streaming in your home. The factors for this can range from leaks, malfunctioning or faulty electrical wiring, or a broken heating element or thermostat. A repair or replacement of the elements may be enough if it is one of the pointed out issues. Nevertheless, if the hot water heater system has all of these problems happening often, then a water heater replacement is necessary.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This permits the sewer lines to be cleaned up quickly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, giving off from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to eliminate debris such as hard water scale, grease, sand, and silt deposits.</p>
