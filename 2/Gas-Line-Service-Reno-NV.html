<p>Water softener systems work by getting rid of hardness minerals and replacing them with salt ions. Water conditioners are devices that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to prevent the scale from developing by reducing the effects of the hardness itself. Due to the truth that water conditioners utilize a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are in some cases thought about a greener alternative in locations where it is forbidden to use salt.

This restoration of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>
