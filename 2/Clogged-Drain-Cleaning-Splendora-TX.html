<p>At least when every 3 months, drain water from the tank. With time sediment develops at the bottom of the heater, which can hamper efficiency, and draining pipes a gallon or two helps remove the sediment. If you find a leak and select a patching job instead of a repiping job, just keep in mind that all the pipes in your home are most likely made from the very same product and they might be next. To prevent further, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you might want to consider repiping your whole home when you spot a leak.</p>
