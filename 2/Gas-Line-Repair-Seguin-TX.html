<h3>Clogged Drains Driving You Crazy Never Call The Emergency Plumber Again Seguin TX</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were thought to be a better option to polybutylene and galvanized piping. Unfortunately, one brand name is experiencing a great deal of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a lot of oxidization. This causes cracks in the tubing that can result in leaks. As these leaks take place, zinc is leached from the fittings on the pipes, causing them to weaken. Finally, chlorinated water has actually been found to trigger fractures in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the very best solution to all of these concerns.</p>
<p>Tom of Gotelli Plumbing supplied excellent service for us in changing a very balky tub spout, and broken toilet parts. Not just was he very professional and extensive however he was able to address all my concerns concerning the service. I would give 6 stars if I could. A video camera inspection of your sewer line is one of the most efficient methods of finding the precise location of a plumbing issue. A plumber will place a specially created waterproof camera through your sewer line and capture live footage to figure out where and what the source of the problem is.</p>
