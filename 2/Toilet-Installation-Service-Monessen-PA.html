<p>The most effective way to address difficult water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the firmness ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When tough water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>If you see rust just in your hot water, then examine the status of your hot water heater's anode rod. You may need a professional to do this if you have actually never ever done this on your own. The rust is most likely coming from the within of your water heater if the anode rod is rusted out. If this is the case, replace your water heater as quickly as possible. On the other hand, if you see rust from both your cold and hot water taps, you more than likely have rusted piping.</p>
