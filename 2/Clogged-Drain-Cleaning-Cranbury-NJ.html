<p>Water softener systems work by getting rid of firmness minerals and replacing them with sodium ions. Water conditioners are devices that help avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They utilize a physical media to hinder the scale from building up by reducing the effects of the solidity itself. Due to the truth that water conditioners use a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are often considered a greener option in locations where it is forbidden to use salt. Water conditioners do not efficiently get rid of hardness from the water supply, however, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
