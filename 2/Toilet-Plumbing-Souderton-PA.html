<p>I had a major sewer problem with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might find on Google. I actually received their number for another company that could not come soon enough however referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me a price quote. They instantly cleared the initial clog, enabling the tenants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon more investigation, there was a considerable clog that required excavation to examine. His group was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary problem and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
