<p>In some cases called an auger, this helpful tool can clear clogs that may be stuck even more down the system. You'll have to dismantle the drainpipe and P-trap that runs underneath the kitchen sink to expose the stub pipe" or stubout" that travels behind the cabinet wall. This is where you insert the snake into the pipe till you feel resistance to break up the clog.</p>
<p>The simplest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a moveable disc connected to a climatic vent. In the event of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outside air. This triggers the disc to open, enabling air to enter the valve and bring back pressure equivalent to ambient atmospheric requirement. This restoration of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>
