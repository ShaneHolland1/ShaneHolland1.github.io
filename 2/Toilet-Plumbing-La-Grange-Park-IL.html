<p>Backsiphonage can take place when there is a sudden reduction in the water pressure of the distribution system, such as during fire combating or when a water pipe breaks. At these occurances, water flow can be reversed. This reversal can develop a suction result and draw potential pollutants into the drinkable (drinking) water system. Tank water heaters are commonly found in a lot of houses. Their elements are an insulated tank, generally holding 30-50 gallons of water, to heat and store the water till it's required. A pipe emerges from the top to provide hot water to its destination, kitchen, bathroom, or other sinks.</p>
<p>At least once every 3 months, drain water from the tank. In time sediment constructs at the bottom of the heater, which can hamper performance, and draining pipes a gallon approximately assists remove the sediment. If you spot a leak and opt for a patching task instead of a repiping job, simply remember that all the pipes in your home are most likely made from the same product and they may be next. To avoid further, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you might want to consider repiping your entire home when you find a leak.</p>
