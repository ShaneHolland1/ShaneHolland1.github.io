<p>The need for backflow preventers is obvious, however how do they work and which designs are best for specific applications? Often the type and installation requirements are defined by ecological guidelines and local statutes. Local building codes for example will need a vertical separation of a minimum of one inch to form an air gap between a faucet opening and the highest possible water level in its sink or basin. The resultant space breaks any possible siphon before it can happen, preventing contaminating water from being sucked back into the pipe system. Other laws can need the installation of more complicated and sophisticated backflow preventers. And the design of these mechanical gadgets installed to avoid backflow range from the relatively basic to the very sophisticated and complicated.</p>
