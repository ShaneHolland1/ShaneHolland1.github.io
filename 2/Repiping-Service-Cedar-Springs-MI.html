Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently get used to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come online to add flow rate capacity. During durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line.
