<p>CPM Plumbing focuses on speedy service, accurate troubleshooting, and accuracy repairs so your service never has to struggle with downtime.

<p>Water softeners resolve a process called ion exchange which eliminates calcium and magnesium from the water. When the difficult water enters into the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, generally made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, indicating they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Considering that opposite charges draw in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is drawn in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the tough water travels through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the salt ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your house.</p>

<h3>Signs That Your Water Heater Needs To Be Repaired Or Replaced in Selden NY</h3>
<p>A clogged drain is another common repair - generally with sinks. In many cases, a sink drain issue is brought on by excessive contaminants or debris inside the drain like hair, grease, hair care items or soaps. While there are numerous chemical drain cleaning options, in some cases this can trigger more damage than assistance. Anytime you find a clogged drain, connect to Resurrection Plumbing to diagnose the issue and advise the ideal repairs.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast majority of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in.. Most house centers bring just one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Also determine how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with a lengthened" design, the door might not close. Keep reading to discover how to install a toilet.</p>
<p>To avoid these things from blocking your drains and triggering damage, Larry & Sons recommends that you utilize hair and food stoppers throughout your house. These awesome additions to your sinks and tubs can reduce the quantity of hair and food scraps that end up in your drains. Lots of garbage disposals will need a new sink drain flange, which consists of the metal disk at the drain entryway at the bottom of the sink along with a short length of pipe that extends below the sink, where the drain connects.</p>
<p>To remove the cable from the old disposer, use a screwdriver to remove the plate covering the electrical connections at the bottom of the system. Detach the wire nuts and pull the cable through the cover plate hole. For preventive maintenance, Larry & Sons offers yearly examinations on your sewer and septic tanks. Our service technicians thoroughly check your entire drainage system with video camera pipe inspection to prevent future problems before they occur. Our yearly maintenance services also include comprehensive drain cleaning to keep your pipes clear.</p>
