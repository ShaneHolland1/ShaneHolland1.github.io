<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves need to stay open and the system should be continually kept track of. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as simple as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm system that notifies the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems utilize both techniques. NFPA 13 describes all such gadgets as supervisory gadgets.</p>
<p>Liners are another popular product sewer cleaners offer nowadays. A liner is a cloth tube covered on one side with a layer of PVC, which is embedded with a two-part epoxy resin. Provider then usually blow the liner into an existing pipe. If your home was built prior to the 1970s or hasn't been renovated, you will probably have old pipes that need replacing.</p>
