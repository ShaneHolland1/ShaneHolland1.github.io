<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively get used to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capacity. During durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
