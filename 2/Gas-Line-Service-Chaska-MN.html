<h3>Plumbing Drainage & Heating Chaska MN</h3>
<p>Seattle Public Utilities needs that any cross connection have a backflow preventer. The backflow preventer may be needed to be found on the water service line, within the building, or both places. After an initial inspection and testing of a recently installed backflow preventer, the water consumer is required to have the backflow preventer checked on an annual basis.</p>
<p>Duty for installation falls upon the owner of the residential or commercial property or the co-op or condominium board. Owners and boards of structures that are issued an order by the DEP to install a backflow preventer should file strategies with the DEP within 30 days. If the DEP has not received certification from a PE, RA, or LMP that the backflow preventer is at least in the process of being set up within that time, a Notice of Offense will be sent out. Violators will be responsible for a civil charge of up to $1,000 issued by the Environmental protection Board (ECB). Continued non-compliance can ultimately lead to civil and criminal procedures and actions, as well as the termination of water service to the building.</p>
