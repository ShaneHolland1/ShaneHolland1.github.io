Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable supply of water pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
