<p>Incorrect drainage slope: Drainage pipes are developed to take waste water away from a home and provide it to the city's sewer system. Many do this utilizing the power of gravity; pipes are sloped to drain water towards the street. Waste water may not drain properly and might flood back into the building if the drainage pipes are not set up at the appropriate degree of slope.</p>
<p>A fantastic method to reduce the amount of food waste in your kitchen is to install a waste disposal unit. Rapidly and efficiently getting rid of remaining potato peels, fruit rinds and numerous other types of food waste, the disposal grinds it all into great particles that are flushed out of the chamber and into the house drainage, waste and vent system or what you most likely call your sewer.</p>

If not, Apollo House's licensed and experienced plumbers will do what it takes to get your garbage disposal grinding away once again or install a new one, often on the very same day.
