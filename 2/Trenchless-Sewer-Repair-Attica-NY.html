<p>The Battelle Study also found hard water to quickly lead to clogged shower heads, sometimes after as low as a year and a half of routine use.

<p>Water softeners can be found in all sizes and shapes and larger definitely does not mean much better. WaterBoss ® uses fine mesh resin - smaller beads that really supply more surface area to soften water. This resin is vacuum-packed to allow optimal capability in a minimum of space. Plus, our patented Directional Flow Screen system helps guarantee that no resin bead goes unused. Our screens and whole-house dirt and sediment filter also secure the resin bed, so we don't need to lose space on freeboard" which is the empty area in traditional water softeners that permit a churning of resin throughout regrowth to release sediment, solidity and dirt.</p>
<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their new home and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to check the line and determine the cause of the problem.

Even even worse, the line could collapse requiring a significant repair or replacement.</p>
