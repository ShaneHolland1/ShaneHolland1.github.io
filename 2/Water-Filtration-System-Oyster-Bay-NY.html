<h3>How to Keep A Clogged Toilet From Becoming A Disaster in Oyster Bay NY</h3>
<p>What is hard water? Scientifically speaking, it is water that contains considerable amounts of liquified minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending on the length of time the water travels through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can get a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some regions than others. While the minerals won't harm your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and rather a nuisance-- for its numerous designated uses around your house.</p>
