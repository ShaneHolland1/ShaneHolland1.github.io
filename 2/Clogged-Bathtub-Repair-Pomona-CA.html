<p>For aid with your toilet repair or replacement project in Manassas or Fairfax, VA, give us a call at 703-331-2100 and get it Semper Fixed today. Prolonged guarantee: Most disposals feature at least a 1-year guarantee, but if you purchase one with a lifetime service warranty (15+ years), it will probably be more costly. While there's not a specific schedule regarding when you need to repipe your house, you must definitely check out repiping if they have not been carried out in 50 years or more-- particularly if you live in an older house built closer to the turn of the last century.</p>
<p>A lot of softeners have a bypass developed into the inlet and the outlet. By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in case you have to supply some kind of maintenance to it and even while you're dealing with installing it. If the softener you select does not have a bypass, then it's a good idea to build one out of plumbing to bypass the devices in case you need to keep the unit.</p>

<p>Recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their brand-new home and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to examine the line and identify the reason for the problem. The line was clearly deteriorating; some areas were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog impended. Even even worse, the line could collapse needing a significant repair or replacement.</p>
