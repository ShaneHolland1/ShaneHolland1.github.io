<h3>Recent Advances in Sewer Drain Cleaning Technology at Fairfield CT</h3>
<p>Typically, there are tank hot water heater that use either gas or electricity for their fuel. Gas storage tank units use practically 50% less energy, costing less to run, than the electric variety. However, they cost a bit more than electric models. They also include a temperature level and pressure-release valve that opens when either temperature level or pressure exceeds pre-programmed levels. We offer gas hot water heater service, as well as electric water heater service, throughout Central New Jersey and the Jersey Coast.</p>
<p>The Battelle Study likewise found difficult water to quickly cause clogged shower heads, sometimes after as low as a year and a half of regular usage. After just one week of continuous testing with difficult water, more than three-fourths of shower head nozzles became clogged, according to lab results. Shower heads using water dealt with by a water softening system, meanwhile, performed nearly in addition to on the day they were installed.</p>
<p>It might be time to get it changed if your water heater has actually required several repairs over the last few years. A great rule of thumb for hot water heater is this: because the lifespan of the average water heater is between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the halfway point. It makes more monetary sense to replace your water heater if the cost of a repair is more than half the cost of a replacement at that point.</p>
<p>Recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their new home and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to examine the line and determine the cause of the issue. The line was plainly degrading; some sections were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog loomed. Even even worse, the line might collapse requiring a major repair or replacement.</p>
