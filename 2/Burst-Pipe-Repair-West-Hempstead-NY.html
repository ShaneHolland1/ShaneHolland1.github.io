<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange units, are home appliances that eliminate calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water.

<h3>How To Stop Emergency Plumbing Water Damages West Hempstead NY</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively get used to your company' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capability. Throughout durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's arguably the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
