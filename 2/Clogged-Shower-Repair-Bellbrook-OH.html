With our professional garbage disposal replacement and installation services, you can be confident that you're all set for years of reliable service. No, the glass will not sharpen the garbage disposal blades. To clean and sharpen the blades, grind a couple of ice in the disposal before running cold water through the system. If that doesn't work, you'll need to install a new unit.</p>
