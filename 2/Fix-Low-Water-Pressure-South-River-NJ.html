<p>If you see rust only in your warm water, then check the status of your water heater's anode rod. If you have actually never done this on your own, you might need a professional to do this. The rust is most likely coming from the inside of your water heater if the anode rod is rusted out. If this is the case, replace your water heater as soon as possible. On the other hand, if you see rust from both your cold and hot water taps, you probably have actually worn away piping.</p>
