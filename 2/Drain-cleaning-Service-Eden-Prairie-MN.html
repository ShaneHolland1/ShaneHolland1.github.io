<p>IRWD is dedicated to delivering safe, high quality water to consumers. Our extensive water quality program operates 24 hr a day, 365 days a year, to guarantee that the water provided to our customers is kept devoid of damaging impurities. An important part of our water quality program is the backflow prevention program When a water line is linked to equipment including a nonpotable compound, this is called a cross-connection. Contamination may happen when water streams through a cross-connection from a nonpotable source, such as a sprinkler system or heating & cooling system, into the potable water system. This can take place through a process referred to as backflow.</p>
