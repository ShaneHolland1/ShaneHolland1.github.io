<p>The typical life expectancy of an electrical water heater is more than that of a gas one. Unseen sets of pipes use pressure to move water through supply lines and out faucets, showerheads or into your toilet.

<p>Loose flanges are generally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws merely won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best service depends on the degree of the rot. Utilize an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Prior to you install this type of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
