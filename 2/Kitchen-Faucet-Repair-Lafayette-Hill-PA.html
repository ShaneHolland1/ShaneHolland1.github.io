<p>Wood pipes were utilized in London and in other places during the 17th and 16th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a small hole in which the water would travel through. 21 The numerous pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wood pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were widely utilized in the USA during the 20th century. These pipes (utilized in location of corrugated iron or reinforced concrete pipes) were made from sections cut from brief lengths of wood. Locking of nearby rings with hardwood dowel pins produced a versatile structure. About 100,000 feet of these wooden pipes were installed during WW2 in drainage culverts, storm sewage systems and conduits, under highways and at army camps, naval stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>
