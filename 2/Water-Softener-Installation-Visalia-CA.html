<h3>Emergency Plumbing Tips For Your Everyday Plumber Visalia CA</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adapt to your company' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation need, tanks come online to add flow rate capability. Throughout periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
