<p>PEX pipes were thought to be a better option to polybutylene and galvanized piping. Sadly, one brand is experiencing a lot of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a lot of oxidization. This causes cracks in the tubing that can lead to leaks. As these leaks happen, zinc is leached from the fittings on the pipes, causing them to deteriorate. Finally, chlorinated water has been found to cause fractures in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the very best solution to all of these issues.</p>
<p>When lime is contributed to the water, it changes the water chemistry, causing the calcium to come out of the option.
