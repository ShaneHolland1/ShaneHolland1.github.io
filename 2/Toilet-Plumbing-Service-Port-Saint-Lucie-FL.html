<p>All of the drains in your home, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your home then leave into the sewer or septic tank from your home. Then that typically means that your main sewer line is backing up when you experience obstructions in multiple drains at when in your home. This can occur in multiple locations and any mix of drains. For instance, water may fill in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are numerous mixes of this kind of backup. The point is your drains all connect, and as soon as you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overflowing from multiple drain lines in your house.</p>
