<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>We concentrate on tub and shower replacement and complete bathroom redesigning at really competitive prices. Turn on the gas and check connections for leakages by brushing a 50-50 mix of dishwashing liquid and water over the joints. If the mixture bubbles, you have a leak. Tighten or reconnect joints that leak. Clean the joints dry when completed. Call the plumbing inspector to check over your work. Follow the how-to suggestions that accompanies the photos to make sure the connections are tight.</p>
<p>It's quite common for debris to wind up being flushed down our drains. Think of how frequently food particles, cooking oil and hair winds up in our showers and sinks. After sufficient time, these products may build up into obstructions, which can obstruct the flow of water throughout a house. This can cause a number of problems, from nasty odors to water leaks and burst pipes.</p>
<h3>Clogged Sink in Portland Michigan</h2>
<p>The upstairs main kitchen drain was clogged with a couple of years of gunk and had actually supported into the downstairs bathroom sink. Mr. Singh did a minimum of 3 attempts to clear the main drain, but the downstairs sink still had standing water in the bowl. Using his knowledge and experience he determined that the drain system from the upstairs sink was clear but the backup was in the branch to the downstairs sink. With a little coaxing, much to my delight, the sink cleared and all the debris went down the recently cleaned up main drain. By adding perseverence and persistence the task was done to my complete satisfaction.</p>
