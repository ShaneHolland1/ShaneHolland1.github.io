<p>PEX pipes were believed to be a much better option to galvanized and polybutylene piping. Sadly, one brand name is experiencing a great deal of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a lot of oxidization. This triggers fractures in the tubing that can result in leakages. As these leakages occur, zinc is leached from the fittings on the pipes, triggering them to deteriorate. Finally, chlorinated water has been discovered to cause fractures in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the very best service to all of these problems.</p>
