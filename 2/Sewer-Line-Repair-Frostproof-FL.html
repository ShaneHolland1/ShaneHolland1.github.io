<p>A lot of softeners have actually a bypass constructed into the outlet and the inlet. By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in the event you need to supply some kind of maintenance to it or perhaps while you're working on installing it. If the softener you choose does not have a bypass, then it's smart to construct one out of plumbing to bypass the equipment in case you need to keep the system.</p>
<p>To prep your unit for installation, you may have to attach a cable with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I attached a cord with a plug package that I bought individually from the disposal system. It's as basic as feeding the wires from the cable through the disposal and connecting them to the matching colors on the unit with wire nuts.</p>
<p>Before selection and installation, refer to manufacturers literature for temperature level varieties. All assemblies should be secured from freezing temperature levels and if installed where temperatures will reach 100 degrees F or above, a hot water type assembly need to be used. Seek advice from manufacturers specifications for suggestions. When searching for plumbing services in the area, be specific with your needs and ask prospects if they are licensed plumbers and if they have the advanced experience and licenses related to a plumbing contractor.</p>
