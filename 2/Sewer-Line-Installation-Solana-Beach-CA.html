When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is utilized to make sure that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the local water supply, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water held in the lawn sprinkler can end up being infected. If permitted to re-enter the supply of water, there is potential for the infected water to end up being a health hazard.

Backflow preventers need to be inspected regularly for efficiency, as well as inspected annually by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
