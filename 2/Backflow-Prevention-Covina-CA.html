Atmos Energy does not keep the natural gas lines on your residential or commercial property beyond our meter, this is the very same as other energies, such as your electrical wiring and pipes. When water enters your house from the main supply of water line, it must just ever stream in one direction: into your house.</p>
<p>The watering backflow testing season is from May to September.
