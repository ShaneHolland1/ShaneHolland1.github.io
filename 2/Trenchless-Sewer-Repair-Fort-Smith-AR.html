<p>Woodbury, along with numerous other communities and organizations, has discovered the very best way to avoid these discolorations from taking place is by minimizing the number of times your water softener regrows. "Regenerating" refers to the way softeners clean all the calcium and magnesium mineral deposits out of the filter medium when it ends up being "tired" or complete. Nevertheless, many water softeners restore too often, when the filter medium truly isn't full. This can be fixed by just resetting your water softener to remove less hardness or to run longer in between regrowth cycles.</p>

<p>As the water treatment industry has actually grown in the U.S., the principle of water softening has frequently been misunderstood as a purifying, cleansing or conditioning procedure. This is due mainly to overstated advertising and, in part, to customer misunderstandings about water treatment. But the truth is that water softening merely removes firmness minerals and eliminates problems that are an annoyance and not a threat to human health. The choice "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of personal preference not necessity. However, water softening does have benefits, and disadvantages, that make this choice a substantial one.</p>
<p>Puronics ® whole-house Chlorostatic ® water softener systems with Chloroshield Clearess ® filter media, are particularly developed to lower the levels chloramine, chlorine and firmness usually found in municipal water products while eliminating the need for filter modifications. Chloramine is a common local water disinfectant, however it is destructive to lead and copper water lines and could have negative effects for individuals and fish. Our Chlorostatic ® water softener systems also use the advanced technology of the iGen ® ... the valve so wise it does the thinking for you to enhance water quality and running effectiveness.</p>
<p>Single flush High Efficiency Toilets (HETs) use 1.28 gallons per flush. The most recent dual flush HET provided by Bonney will utilize an average of 1.1 gallons per flush. This is where we disagree with InSinkErator. We suggest, as the majority of plumbers do, to utilize disposals sparingly. Proper care and garbage disposal maintenance will keep it running long past its guarantee and keep your drain lines clear.</p>
