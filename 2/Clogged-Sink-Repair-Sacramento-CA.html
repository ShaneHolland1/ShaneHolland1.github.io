<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a worn flapper is usually the perpetrator. However not always. Initially, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing firmly if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with too little slack can trigger problem too. Photo 3 shows how to set the slack just right.</p>
