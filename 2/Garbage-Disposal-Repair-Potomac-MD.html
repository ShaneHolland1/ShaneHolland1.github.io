<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from normal flow direction within a piping system that is triggered by negative pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the turnaround of normal circulation in a system triggered by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the supply of water piping).

This seal weakens with time allowing water to escape into the toilet bowl, hence decreasing the quantity of water in the tank available for a flush.  It likewise has the disadvantage of increasing your water expense due to waste of water.</p>
