<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to just abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason why we will recommend a full repipe in specific areas, based on our experience.</p>

These clever additions to your tubs and sinks can reduce the quantity of hair and food scraps that wind up in your drains.
