<p>Pretty little flappers might get all the glory in the toilet world, however the journey lever is the bridge in between man and machine. After all, if the trip lever doesn't lift the flapper to flush the toilet, you have to wiggle and wiggle and sometimes even stick your hand in there and lift the flapper manually. And who wants to do all that work??? In all seriousness though, making certain your journey lever is working well can conserve you the inconvenience of those little everyday inconveniences - that the majority of people simply live with and never ever realize they can fix in about 5 minutes - not to point out the gallons of water wasted every day by a bad seal.</p>
