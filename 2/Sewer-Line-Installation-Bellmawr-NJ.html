<p>I had a significant sewer issue with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I might discover on Google. I in fact got their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and offer me a quote. They instantly cleared the preliminary clog, allowing for the occupants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon more examination, there was a substantial blockage that needed excavation to examine. His team was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 â² hole. After repairing this initial issue and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
