<p>To identify which toilet valve is causing the trouble, look at the overflow tube. If water is overruning into the tube, there's an issue with the toilet fill valve. If the water level is below the top of the tube, the flush valve is leaking, enabling water to trickle into the bowl. That sluggish, continuous outflow of water avoids the fill valve from closing totally. We removed the fronts and backs of brand-new toilets to show you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts will not look so beautiful inside. You'll find scummy surface areas, water stains and rust.
