With the everyday use of gas, it is understandable it is easy to understand that with time a leak is bound to occur.

<p>The simplest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a portable disc connected to an atmospheric vent. In the event of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outdoors air. This activates the disc to open, allowing air to get in the valve and bring back pressure comparable to ambient atmospheric standard. This remediation of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>
