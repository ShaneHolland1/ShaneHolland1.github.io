<h3>Plumbing, Drains & Water Cleanup Waseca MN</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were believed to be a much better alternative to galvanized and polybutylene piping. Unfortunately, one brand is experiencing a great deal of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a lot of oxidization. This causes cracks in the tubing that can result in leaks. As these leakages take place, zinc is leached from the fittings on the pipes, triggering them to weaken. Lastly, chlorinated water has been discovered to trigger cracks in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the very best option to all of these concerns.</p>
<p>A new trend in re-piping is sand blasting the within used thin pipe and the painting the inside of the worn pipe with epoxy paint. In some cases during the sandblasting the sandblasting will use thin and blow through the wall of pipes and joints. Some of those thin areas leak right away and in some cases those leaks come days or weeks later on. Leaking pipes that are epoxy-coated end up needing to be properly re-piped by installing a CDA copper re-pipe.</p>
