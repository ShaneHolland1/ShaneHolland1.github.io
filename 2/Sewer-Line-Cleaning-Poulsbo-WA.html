I in fact got their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me a price quote. They right away cleared the initial clog, allowing for the occupants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon additional examination, there was a significant blockage that needed excavation to investigate. His group was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary concern and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
