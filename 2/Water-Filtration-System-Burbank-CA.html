If you smell a strong whiff of gas from your vehicle when it is running, you might have a gas leak from the fuel line. It is vital to repair this instantly to prevent an explosion. It is best to take your vehicle to a certified mechanic if you are not certain of your repair abilities.</p>

<p>Secure the drain hose. The water softener needs to drain the depleted salt water option after the regrowth cycle. Clamp the drain hose safely and feed it into the dedicated drain, like a floor drain or utility sink. To prevent the hose back siphoning waste water, all drain hoses should have an air gap. The end of the hose be at least 2 inches above the devoted drain. An air gap may be used to accomplish this, and may be needed depending on local plumbing codes.</p>
