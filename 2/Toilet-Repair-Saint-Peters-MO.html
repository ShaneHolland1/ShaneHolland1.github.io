<p>PEX pipes were thought to be a much better option to polybutylene and galvanized piping. Sadly, one brand name is experiencing a lot of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a lot of oxidization. This triggers cracks in the tubing that can lead to leaks. As these leaks occur, zinc is seeped from the fittings on the pipes, causing them to weaken. Finally, chlorinated water has actually been discovered to cause cracks in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the very best option to all of these issues.</p>
<p>To determine if your home is a poly home," begin with the exterior. Underground water pipe are typically blue in color (they can also be gray or black). The pipe is typically 1/2 to 1-inch in size. Often, it enters the house near the water heater. Your main shut off is attached to completion of the water pipe. Ensure you check both ends of the pipe. We have discovered cases where the copper pipe gets in the house and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>

<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the formula! To simply put some media inside a tank and expect the best is typical in our industry and numerous companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other style on the marketplace. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under extreme temperature levels. It's just with the media and the fluidization correctly collaborating that you can accomplish this.</p>
