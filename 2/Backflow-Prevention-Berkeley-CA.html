<h3>Choosing The Right Plumbing Service Berkeley CA</h3>
<p>The most efficient way to attend to difficult water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When difficult water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>A new trend in re-piping is sand blasting the within worn thin pipe and the painting the inside of the worn pipe with epoxy paint. Often during the sandblasting the sandblasting will wear thin and blow through the wall of pipes and joints. A few of those thin areas leak right away and in some cases those leakages come days or weeks later on. Leaking pipes that are epoxy-coated end up needing to be correctly re-piped by installing a CDA copper re-pipe.</p>
