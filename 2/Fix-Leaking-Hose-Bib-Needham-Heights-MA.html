<p>A water softener works by utilizing electrical charges to get rid of the minerals.

<h3>Things To Consider Before Hiring A Plumber Needham Heights MA</h3>
<p>We genuinely appreciate our clients and the services that we provide. As hard water goes through a softener, the calcium and magnesium trade places with salt ions (Figure 1). Salt ions are held loosely and are replaced quickly by calcium and magnesium ions. During this procedure, complimentary" salt ions are released into the water. The time between recharging cycles depends on the firmness of the water, the quantity of water used, the size of the unit and the capacity of the exchange media to remove firmness.</p>
<p>it is always an excellent idea to arrange an independent plumbing inspection outside of the house owners' inspection.
