<p>Covert water leaks are often difficult and have Potentially Serious Effects. Changing your flapper might require somewhat different actions than we show (Photos 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Finding a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the task if you have an unusual flush valve. To find an appropriate replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware shop. (Shut off the water before removing the flapper.) You may not find an identical match, however possibilities are you'll find among the exact same shape and diameter. If not, attempt a plumbing supply shop (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Supplies") or search online.</p>
