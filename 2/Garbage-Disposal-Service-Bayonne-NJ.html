<p>Pretty little flappers might get all the splendor in the toilet world, but the journey lever is the bridge in between guy and machine. After all, if the trip lever does not lift the flapper to flush the toilet, you need to jiggle and wiggle and in some cases even stick your hand in there and raise the flapper by hand. And who wants to do all that work??? In all seriousness though, making certain your trip lever is working well can save you the hassle of those small daily inconveniences - that most people simply cope with and never ever realize they can fix in about 5 minutes - not to point out the gallons of water lost every day by a bad seal.</p>
