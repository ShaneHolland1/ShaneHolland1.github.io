<h3>Plumbing Company Serving Bonaire GA</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively get used to your service' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capability. Throughout durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's perhaps the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
