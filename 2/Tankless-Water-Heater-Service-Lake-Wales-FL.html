I in fact received their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough however referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me an estimate. They instantly cleared the initial obstruction, allowing for the tenants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon further investigation, there was a significant clog that needed excavation to investigate. His group was on website the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial concern and installing a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
