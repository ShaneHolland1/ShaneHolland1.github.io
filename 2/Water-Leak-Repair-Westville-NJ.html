<p>Backflow preventers are crucial for developing a safe water system system. No matter which model you choose, all water softeners need to be appropriately preserved. The salt water option must be combined and kept in the brine tank. Regular clogging of the resin also requires unique attention. For instance, if the raw supply of water is turbid it might clog the resin with mud and clay. Often, typical backwashing with water will solve this problem. If not, slowly stir the resin during the backwash cycle to help break up the product. Also, bacteria and fungi also form mats in the resin that lower its effectiveness. Sanitizing the water prior to softening or regularly cleaning the softener with chlorine bleach will get rid of these annoyances. However, check out the producer's directions before adding any chemicals to the system.</p>
