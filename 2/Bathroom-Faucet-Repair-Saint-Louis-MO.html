<p>However, since a waste disposal unit is only expected to last in between 10 to 12 years, a replacement will become needed. This is especially real for disposals that are used regularly due to the fact that their blades will quickly pall. Another time that a replacement will be required is when the motor stops operating completely.</p>
<p>Check the status of your water heater's anode rod if you see rust only in your hot water. If you've never ever done this on your own, you may need a professional to do this. If the anode rod is rusted out, the rust is probably coming from the inside of your water heater. Replace your water heater as soon as possible if this is the case. On the other hand, if you see rust from both your cold and hot water taps, you probably have actually corroded piping.</p>
