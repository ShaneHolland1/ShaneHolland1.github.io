<p>Set out the new disposal and parts in preparation for installation. I've been to numerous carwashes that have a softener, and to the surprise of the owners, the water tests hard even after having actually gone through the softener. Typically, this is since the system is outdated or not working effectively. Whatever the factor, you can be losing out on the benefits of soft water without even understanding it.</p>

<p>Place the flange on the top of the sink, and connect the attachment system on the underside (Image 1). It is handy to use pressure on the flange from above using a 2nd set of hands or a heavy things. This will keep the flange in location while attaching the securing system below. Make certain the plumber's putty is noticeably exuding beyond the edge of the flange all around (Image 2). When a complete seal has formed, get rid of the excess putty with a rag.</p>
