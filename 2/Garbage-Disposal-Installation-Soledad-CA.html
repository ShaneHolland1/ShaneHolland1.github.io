<p>PEX pipes were thought to be a much better option to galvanized and polybutylene piping. Sadly, one brand is experiencing a lot of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a great deal of oxidization. This causes cracks in the tubing that can result in leaks. As these leakages happen, zinc is leached from the fittings on the pipes, causing them to weaken. Lastly, chlorinated water has been found to cause fractures in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the very best solution to all of these issues.</p>
<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable supply of water pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
