<p>I had a major sewer problem with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might discover on Google. I really got their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me a quote. They instantly cleared the initial obstruction, enabling the tenants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon further investigation, there was a substantial blockage that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole.
