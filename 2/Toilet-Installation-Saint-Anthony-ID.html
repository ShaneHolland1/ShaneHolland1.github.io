<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable water supply pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>

<p>After showing up after their window, they began to investigate the kitchen sink (and after among the two gentlemen tossed up outside), they ran a snake down the sink and after that put the sink back together but declared they wouldn't take obligation if it dripped now because of some undefined curiosity in how my sink was put together. After they gave me the "don't put grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I noticed they managed to reassemble the sink in such a way that the sprayer hose was wrapped around the plumbing. I didn't even bother to try calling them back, given that I never ever want to see this company again.</p>
<p>Although these homeowners didn't feel lucky at the time, it was definitely excellent timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe remained in good enough shape to reline before the issue got worse. Waiting just wasn't an option. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a removed garage. At the least, it would have been a very pricey alternative.</p>
