<p>Wooden pipes were utilized in London and somewhere else throughout the 17th and 16th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a small hole in which the water would travel through. 21 The several pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were utilized in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were commonly utilized in the U.S.A. throughout the 20th century. These pipes (utilized in location of corrugated iron or strengthened concrete pipes) were made from sections cut from short lengths of wood. Locking of nearby rings with hardwood dowel pins produced a flexible structure. About 100,000 feet of these wooden pipes were set up during WW2 in drainage culverts, storm drains and channels, under highways and at army camps, marine stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>
