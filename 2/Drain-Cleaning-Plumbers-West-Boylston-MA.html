<p>Electric water heaters do have a couple of downsides however that deserve mentioning. Firstly, electricity is not as low-cost as gas. Some utility companies charge greater rates for electrical power during peak periods such as really early in the early morning and in the evening. Using your heater during these peak periods can increase your power bills. On the hand, gas is cheap and has a set rate. Another disadvantage of an electrical hot water heater is that they can be costly to install, especially when it pertains to whole-house tankless systems.</p>
<p>Eventually, however, the beads reach optimal capacity and can't bring in anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank need to be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank can be found in. An on-board computer computes the quantity of water that streams through the softener. Regrowth immediately begins when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom home and household of four, regrowth normally happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
