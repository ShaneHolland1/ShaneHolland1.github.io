<p>After getting here after their window, they began to investigate the kitchen sink (and after among the two gentlemen threw up outside), they ran a snake down the sink and after that put the sink back together but claimed they wouldn't take responsibility if it dripped now since of some unspecified oddities in how my sink was put together. After they gave me the "do not put grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I saw they managed to reassemble the sink in such a way that the sprayer hose was twisted around the plumbing. I didn't even trouble to attempt calling them back, because I never ever wish to see this company once again.</p>
<p>Recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line in between their brand-new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we utilized our sewer camera to check the line and identify the cause of the problem. The line was plainly deteriorating; some areas were just held together by the ground around them. Another clog impended. Even worse, the line could collapse requiring a significant repair or replacement.</p>
