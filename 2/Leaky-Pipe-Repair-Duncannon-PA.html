If the hot water heater has actually been preserved with annual flush service, it can likely last beyond its standard warranty. All secondary sources of water, such as wells or plumbing systems that are exposed to possible contamination or poorer quality water, require a backflow prevention device.</p>
<p>He dug two holes on either side of the pipe and was able to blast the old, damaged pipe out while changing it with a brand-new one at the very same time. We did a follow-up call to the property owner several weeks later on, and she reported no excess water in her backyard. Job well done: You do not wish to end up with gunk and water all over your kitchen floor. Leaving the job to a qualified plumber makes sure a smooth installation process.</p>
