<p>The drains in the average home get continuous usage. Hair, food scraps, soap scum, and other debris can gradually develop over time. The drain will gradually slow until it ends up being entirely clogged. Chemical drain cleaners sold in stores have limited efficiency. Although the drain may seem to clear at first, the outcome is typically short-term and the clog quickly returns. Utilizing these chemicals regularly can cause damage to your plumbing pipes.</p>

If so, you may need to include a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you do not currently have one. This usually includes anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the overall cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
