<p>Wooden pipes were utilized in London and somewhere else throughout the 16th and 17th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a small hole in which the water would travel through. 21 The several pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were widely utilized in the U.S.A. during the 20th century. These pipes (utilized in place of corrugated iron or enhanced concrete pipes) were made of areas cut from brief lengths of wood. Locking of surrounding rings with wood dowel pins produced a flexible structure. About 100,000 feet of these wooden pipes were installed throughout WW2 in drainage culverts, storm sewers and avenues, under highways and at army camps, naval stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>
