In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to just desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future.
