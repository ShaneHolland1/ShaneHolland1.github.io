As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey. Depending upon the length of time the water takes a trip through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can get a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals will not harm your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and quite an annoyance-- for its numerous designated uses around your home.</p>
