<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems.

Throughout durations of high flow need, tanks come online to add flow rate capability. Throughout periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line.
