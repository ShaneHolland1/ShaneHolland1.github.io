This could be due to a backup of clogged sewage that cant get to the main sewer lines. The cost to convert an electric stove to gas averages $400 for an existing gas line.

<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from normal flow instructions within a piping system that is caused by negative pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the reversal of typical circulation in a system brought on by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the supply of water piping). Back-siphonage can occur when there is a high velocity in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is reduced main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as during fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>
<p>The very best way to prevent clogged drains is to utilize an enzyme drain cleaner as preventive maintenance. Enzyme cleaners like Lenzyme introduce enzymes and bacteria into your drain system to eat away the gunk and build up. You can utilize this once a month to keep your drains devoid of buildup. Find out more about enzyme drain cleaners and how to use them here.</p>
<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health threat for individuals on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Typically, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to begin with. Harder water will result in more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in sodium is small, but if you've been recommended by a doctor to follow a strict low salt diet this increase can posture problems.</p>
