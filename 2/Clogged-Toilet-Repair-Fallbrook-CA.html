<p>When lime is added to the water, it alters the water chemistry, causing the calcium to come out of the solution. The particles of calcium combine, become heavier than the remainder of the water and sink to the bottom of the holding basins. The clear water then moves into the next step of the treatment process. Versatile gas lines are normally more effective to inflexible lines, particularly in areas where earthquakes are more common and for the connection in between the supply and device. Flexible gas lines are less most likely to be detached in a natural disaster which reduces the threat of a surge or fire.</p>
