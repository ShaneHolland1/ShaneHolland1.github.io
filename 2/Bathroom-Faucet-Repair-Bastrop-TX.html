<p>A water softener is a whole-house filtration system that gets rid of hardness-causing calcium and magnesium minerals from your water through a process called ion exchange.  A water softener addresses one of the most widespread and devastating water problems: difficult water.  Hard water damaged the modern-day house. Scale builds up in your pipes, blocking them and decreasing water pressure.  Scale drastically shortens the life expectancy of appliances like dishwashing machines, coffee makers and ice machines. Hard water damages warm water appliances. The greater the temperature level of the water, the more calcium and magnesium will solidify and harden into solid deposits inside your warm water heater.</p>
